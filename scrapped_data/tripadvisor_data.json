Having been fortunate to sit in the sunshine on one of two tables outside, and have the most delicious food and warm, friendly service, I felt almost like life was back to normal again. The two course lunch was fabulous. Excellent choices, we shared two starters, the hummus and their fabulous filo pasty cheese filled spring rolls. They were so delicious. We both had vegetarian mousaka, and though not what was expected mentally in our minds, the taste was incredible. "},

We were greeted with smiling warmth by Marta and Ana, and shown to a table of our choice. Since Covid 19, Capricho takes it very seriously and there were sanitisers at the door, with glass shields in place, and social distancing guidelines honoured; you felt very safe. Armed with Jungel, Capirao, and Pornstar Martini cocktails, we made our selection from a varied menu. There was Pica Pau, Gambas Whisky, and chicken and peaches, as starters; all were full of flavour and beautifully presented. For our mains, there were five fish grill; monkfish and prawns on a skewer; and a monkfish, clam, and prawn rice pot: the taste was astounding. This was baptised with a new rose wine, which was light and fruity. We were then joined by Carlos, and we enjoyed the chat. We concluded this culinary delight with ginginha, Beiraos - plus complimentary ones: muito 'brigado Marta and Carlos.

Firstly, they adhered to the safety guidelines and sanitisers were within easy reach; the tables respected the social distancing parameters, and the staff wore suitable protection. That said, it was great entering their bifolding doors once more and to be greeted with warmth by Cristina, Marta, and Carlos; it was wonderful seeing their smiling faces. We were soon shown to our table of choice. The decor is still welcoming with light-greys and hanging and recessed lighting that gives warmth, yet is bright enough to read the menus. The background music set the atmosphere wonderfully. The three of us relished the happy yet relaxing mood generated by Capricho. Armed with refreshing Jungel, Capirao, and Pornstar cocktails we made our selection from quite a varied menu. Starters: Gambas Whisky, Pica Pau, and Gambas Pimento. Respectively, these were: prawns in a whisky-garlic sauce; cubed tuna with garnish; spicy prawns; all were full of flavour and perfectly prepared and presented. Our mains consisted of five fish; monkfish and prawns on a skewer; and monkfish, clams, and rice pot. Again, they were tasty and devoured in seconds. This culinary perfection was baptised with a chilled Prosecco to toast Capricho's reopening, and it complemented our meal perfectly. We concluded this gastronomic gluttony with Beiraos, black Americano, and a Cappuccino - plus complimentary ones from our gracious hosts - obrigado. My wife, Angela, and I, have now known Marta, Carlos and their splendid team since they first opened, and we seemed to have hit it off really well; they are now more like friends and family, and it's always great catching up with all of them. So, yet again, thanks for the welcome, chat, laughter, perfect service, and smiling friendship. Our compliments to the talented chefs who had worked so hard and successfully on their flavourful concoctions. Until our next invasion, keep healthy, be safe and, above all, be happy. Until then, muito 'brigado and keep smiling."},

There is no restaurant like it in the area for good, honest, seasonal British and French cuisine/cookery. After speaking to one of the waitresses i was shocked to hear Harvey the new head chef was only 25! The chef and his team are very talented and there passion for food clearly comes across whether having shakshuka for brunch to monkfish off the ala carte. Both i can personally recommend!! Delicious! I was very pleased to hear they also are doing there takeout option during tier 3/4 cant wait to give it a try soon!

They also have a new Head Chef. I was looking for somewhere for breakfast and to my surprise found that Friends is now open for breakfast and have a fantastic menu. I opted for the Shaksuka (spicy and aromatic, beautifully runny eggs, I'm still thinking of it now) and my husband had the Eggs Royale (silky hollandaise, perfectly poached eggs). We also opted for a cheeky Bellini as it's Friday and why the devil not?! The food was impeccable as was the service.

The food isn't bad, but not that authentic and no pho on the menu - odd for a Vietnamese. What has changed is the price. As a group of 6 we were told when booking we had to order both a starter and main each, which seems an arbitrary rule to make extra money. The cheapest starter was \u00a36, most were \u00a37 and summer rolls were \u00a38 and mostly noodle inside. Dipping sauce was hoi sin (Chinese!) or chilli - no noac cham as you'd expect at a Vietnamese. Mains are mostly \u00a314 or \u00a315 if you want meat involved. With BYO corkage of \u00a32 a head, tap water, the mandatory starter and main each and the mandatory 10% tip, we spent \u00a327 a head. It's just too much, especially when the food is only ok.

The restaurant has gone to lengths to make it very safe, with tables well spaced apart and lots of cleaning evident. But it is the food that makes this place very special, they have nailed the combination of traditional Portugeuse flavours with modern cuisine. We had the whisky prawns and clams for starters that were both very fresh and tasty. I had the rib eye steak which was mouth watering, tender and packed with flavour, perfectly accompanied by sweet potato fries and creamed spinach. Drinks and desserts were also amazing and the service was excellent. I don\u2019t think you can find a better Portugeuse restaurant in London! Thank you Capricho. "},

We'll, the food was so disappointing. The selection of food, in particular the mains buffet, was poor. The roast beef was burnt to a crisp. The lamb tasted of...I'm not sure what it tasted of but it certainly didn't taste of lamb. No one had the chicken so I can't comment on that. Probably the best section was the starters buffet. Quite a comprehensive selection. The desserts were pretty average. The custard was like water ! I was, like all the guests at the table, very disappointed in the quality of the food and for sure will not be returning here. The price you pay for this buffet is not cheap and therefore you expect something much better than what you'd get at the Toby Carvery.! . The service was probably the only good thing. No complaints there. I would not recommend going to this buffet based on my experience last night."},

It was my husbands birthday so thought as he likes a good Turkish grill this would be a nice way to celebrate. I booked a table which was a total waste of time as the tables are not reserved so we had to wait until a table was ready. Then when our table was ready, we were seated next to the toilets. Now who wants to have their birthday meal sat next to the toilets. On telling the manager his response was \u201ceveryone has booked a table\u201d. Sorry not good enough. I personally was ready to leave however my family insisted we persevere. We ordered the Lara Feast. The bread and dips were lovely and the meats and rice cooked well. Another down point had lamb chops but no steak knife which was definitely needed. Waitresses were rushed off their feet so service was inconsistent however appreciated efforts and so rewarded with a tip. The Lara Grill has the potential to be really good but basic service let\u2019s it down. Would I visit again. Maybe as a walk in (where in that case would be happy to sit anywhere) but for a special get together. Definitely NOT."},

After lockdown it REALLY blew up. We had to pop in to Kingston after work mid week to take some stuff back and decided to go here and finally try it. You can\u2019t book online so at first I was thinking will it be busy/won\u2019t it. When we arrived there was no tables inside only outside. It wasn\u2019t raining and wasn\u2019t too cold so we was happy to sit outside. They were actually installing heaters when we arrived so soon I think there will be heaters outside for guests as the inside availability is limited due to Covid. We wasn\u2019t cold at all though and I didn\u2019t have a coat so I would say sitting outside isn\u2019t an issue. The owner was sat on the table next to us and he was lovely and friendly. I have to say EVERY member of staff here is friendly, informative and generally seem happy to be there. I cannot STAND restaurants where the staff look like they wanna leave or rush you through the menu. I LOVE it when you\u2019re looking at the menu and the staff recommend dishes or talk about the menu with passion. Our waiter (I think he was called Charlie) was recommending loads of dishes and telling us what sauces went best with each item etc. But with genuine excitement as if he knew we was gonna love it! There is nothing better than when the staff have tried the food and love it enough to be passionate about recommending it. Also the gentleman serving our drinks was so lovely and he made an effort to ask us if we was enjoying our drinks and also made an effort to recommend cocktails to have. He was also really friendly and informative. I feel like the food is really good value for money. We ordered some of the nibbles to start... we thought they would be really tiny, as they wasn\u2019t that expensive. The portions were MASSIVE! The hot and blue chicken lollipops and popcorn cauliflower were both insane. I wish they had never ended. For mains we both had Po\u2019 Boys. one chicken and one pork. Both lovely!! The owner came over had a chat with us at the end and he deserves all the success he has, he is such a genuine and lovely guy who even made an effort to tell us how amazing the other restaurants around him were. He told us to visit the wine bar for the cheeses one night and also told us his next door neighbour did the most amazing curry that we will try one night! We will be going back here! There is nothing like this around here and it\u2019s the perfect addition to Kingston! It\u2019s giving people a reason the travel to Kingston from surrounding areas. "},

We all enjoyed the food and the ambience and we are a pretty discerning group. You can often tell when you begin to read your greeted by the staff and start to read your menus how the evening will go. Other diners too seem to give off positive and negative vibes. At a la Russe all was positive. But on to the food, we were blown away by the quality and value offered. To start three of us had scallops with a pea ravioli and an apple/thyme veloute. This was simply delicious and if I close my eyes I can still taste the sweet, perfectly cooked scallops. The roasted peach and goats cheese with parma ham chosen by my partner was also very much enjoyed. We decided to take advantage of the sorbet/Prosecco based palate cleansers one with Vodka and the other Calvados. Again we would recommend. Our mains consisted of a Fillet steak in a green pepper and brandy sauce. It came cooked as requested (medium rare) and was said to be flavoursome and like cutting through butter. Another of the group opted for the Chicken breast involtini style which was rolled with halloumi, chorizo and parma ham was served with a spicy tomatoe sauce - this was another hit. Two of us plumped for the lamb cutlets which we thought were very good value. They were serves with a wine, shallot and rosemary jus these were soft, cooked to perfection and simply delicious. We ordered four sides to share which are reasonably priced at \u00a33.50 to \u00a34.00. There is a good selection of desserts but only two of us were able to manage them. I would have liked the crepe suzette but none of my companions were up for it. Also due to Covid restrictions it can't be prepared at the table so I'd have missed that show element. Instead I ordered an Eton Mess (well it did seem appropriate) It was good just sweet enough without being too sweet with a good mix of strawberries and decent size chunks of meringue. My other companion had the Tiramisu which again was well received. All in all a very enjoyable evening and somewhere we would definitely return to. The staff were friendly and efficient and were able to make us smile when referring to the rather long pepper grinder as one for social distancing. Oh and there is a glass floor panel in the restaurant where you can see right down into the wine cellar. Very quirky. We meant to ask about the history but were so engrossed in the food we forgot. If you go perhaps you could do so and let us know. But do go if you live in the area we would highly recommend."},

Given it was the last night before lockdown we were offered a table without a prior booking, and we were amazed by the absolute attentiveness of you guys! Not often do we write a review but we were so compelled to say how impressed we were. From the moment we sat down, we were waited on so sincerely, from cocktail recommendations to friendly banter, we were made to feel so at home! It was like hanging out with old friends... with lockdown on the horizon, many bars we visited this evening had run out of drinks, staff didn\u2019t seem welcoming, however you guys were on top form and blew us away! So thank you, for your sincere service, and we look forward to popping by for takeaway over the next month. You\u2019re a shot above the rest. We will definitely be recommending you to our friends.

Proper American food done very very well (I personally think \u201cAmerican\u201d food is done poorly in the U.K. Like I never enjoy Bodeans when I eat there as an example.) The service is always top notch. Friendly staff that clearly care about the experience their patrons are having. Everyone seems to enjoy working there! Chatty and happy. Drinks are great. I remember when they didn\u2019t have any draught beer! That was a big upgrade in my opinion. A mix of classic and classic with a twist cocktails are done well also. If Gordon Ramsey ate at Carved, he would say the food/drinks/overall brand is executed brilliantly 100%. I\u2019m no chef or restaurateur but I think Carved is so Franchiseable.

When he eventually got here he said he had gone back to the restaurant and the food had been cooked then. Obviously, whoever I spoke to had not been telling me the truth. I asked to speak to the manager but was told he was 'away'. Of course, when I opened the bag, the food was cold and certainly nowhere near the quality of the food we had in the restaurant. The small poppadoms were oily and tasteless, totally unlike the ones we had in the restaurant A waste of \u00a332.85 for chicken masala, rice, dal, a plain nan and poppadums for one person.

It has most certainly become our Indian restaurant of choice but is usually saved for a special occasion as its prices are more than we can afford to pay on a regular basis. On this occasion the Chancellor himself was subsidising our meal so how could we refuse? As ever, we enjoyed the buzz in the place, the stylish interiors, the Bollywood dance sequences screened on a wall and the friendly masked staff. However it is the food that is the real star here and we were not disappointed in our choices. The Laphroaig flavoured tandoori chicken is a marvellous dish and the lamb was as tender as, well as tender as lamb can be. I had decided to score our experience 4 out of 5 ( docking a point for the investment required) but that is just churlish in these benighted times so a 5 it is, and thoroughly well deserved."},

We were seated by an open door, not ideal being October. The menus were paper, and unsure if these can be cleaned what with virus concerns. The waiter asked us if we would like to hear his recommendations so we said yes, for him then to mention all the most expensive options on the menu - salmon, lamb shank etc (me rolling my eyes). We ordered some starters and mains. Didn\u2019t take too long to arrive. The starter looked pretty, but was a bit spicy for what was advertised on the menu. I ordered a Red pumpkin curry for my main, and oh my, what a disappointment. It was basically the smallest pathetic little cubes of pumpkin which were still relatively hard, in a bowl full of sauce which swamped the pumpkin, may as well have just been the sauce. It was way too spicy, with a one chilli symbol on the menu I was surprised, and with a burning mouth advised the waiter it was too spicy and he went and got me some yoghurt (a bit of a wait tho). The yoghurt helped and I ate a little more before I got bored of the tough bits of pumpkin and the undercooked garlic naan. I ordered a vanilla ice cream for dessert as my mouth still burned and horrified that for \u00a36 I was produced two scoops of ice cream which was the cheapest ice cream you can imagine, something you would buy in Iceland. So disappointing as at the price I would have expected a nice proper vanilla ice cream. So we ask for the bill, and for 4 with only 3 beers came to \u00a3155, which I thought was a lot. I checked the bill, and I had been charged for the yoghurt - \u00a34 for some yoghurt to help me eat my food with the stupid amount of spice they put in my curry. I was so annoyed I said something and was told \u201cwe have to charge for yoghurt sorry\u201d. I mean, not only was the food poor, but that for me was just out of order. To note - in any other curry house I have been too, if something is a bit too spicy I have always been offered yoghurt with no extra cost. "},

The restaurant sits on the corner of Evelyn Gardens and Kew Road in Richmond. The corner spot, and the green foliage that surrounds the building, make it one of the more attractive eateries on this street. I took a date here on a Saturday evening in mid-September. We arrived at 9pm and on arrival were shown to a romantic table for two by the window at the front of the restaurant. The tables are placed very closely together and while I didn\u2019t feel they were so close that the other diners were listening to our conversation, the tables are definitely less than two metres apart (and there was no hand sanitiser available on entry) so bear this in mind if you are particularly Covid-conscious. The restaurant is dimly lit with dark wood d\u00e9cor and lots of wine bottles line the shelves, serving as ornamentation."},

Derrick,who greeted us, seems to have to ability to keep all his customers happy at the same time, making you feel very special. He made us the most tasty baguette ever,when we went there last Sunday to listen to some 'folk singing' friends perform. My partner had a good discussion about the wine to help with his choice whilst I had cups of tea made for me, all with such a smile, brilliant. There is always a great feeling in this venue/bar/cafe and I just wish it was much closer to where we live so we could go more often. But always well worth the trip. Thanks Norma & Mac"},

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever tried, sweet but not as sweet to make me sick like some cheesecakes do. Ice cream added to sticky ginger pudding was some new flavour for me, you can't describe it you got to try it.

We had both been really looking forward to our meal out tonight but it was frankly awful. We ordered with the app from our table. We see little point of this as there was very limited description and a long wait. We had to remind them about our drinks order. When the food did arrive initially it was cold. The second round of drinks and an appetizer were cancelled as there seemed little point as after a very poor meal we just wanted to leave. Why ask if we have any food allergies ( we do to mushrooms , )if you're going to ignore it or not read it at all. The tempura vegetables with the included mushrooms were quite possibly the largest sliced still raw vegetables we've ever seen!!! If my wife had eaten this , this would have caused her a severe reaction. \\The app asked twice about allergies and we duly filled it in - pointless. We sent back a chicken yakitori dish as it was cold and the other starter was tepid. It seems obvious to us that they had to much going on with the takeaway collections to give any quality food or time to their sit down customers. It's ok to be apologetic but having only 3 people doing front of house with one dedicated to take out isn't good enough. Get more staff or concentrate on one thing - you're doing two things badly rather than one thing well.. Yes these are difficult times but come on get it right!!!"},

We did an order for collection and I went to pick it up they said they already took the 10% off Which they actually hadn\u2019t done and I had to prove it to them and it took 10 minutes to actually get the 10% discounted. The food was fair to middling although it was mainly on a Korean tilt. The sashimi was cut too thick and the Gyoza was deep fried and tasted of oil. The kimchi Gyoza had no spice to it whatsoever. The special rolls were amazing. It\u2019s a hit and miss depending on what you order. I will try and order again and maybe try some of the Korean dishes but he\u2019s not a great Japanese restaurant by any shakes.A lot of the dishes were cheaper on uber eats than they were on collection prices.

Yes it\u2019s run by Italians but it felt that the passionate Italian spirit had faded. This was not the fine dining experience we were expecting. Most of the diners were casually dressed, the tables were laid out more similarly to a cafe than a restaurant. Even the food menus were scruffy reused paper printouts (not what we expected especially during the COVID pandemic). There are many other restaurants that provide a much better experience so I can not recommend. "},

A new and fresh style of Italian restaurant. The food is amazing and very tasty and portions more generous than usual. Fresh top quality ingredients. Many pizza options are inventive and unusual tasty combinations. The cheese and charcuteri platter is beyond generous and one of the best I had. Served with a great selection of bruchetta with different toppings. Plenty of quality wine to choose from by the glass and not more expensive than buying a bottle so great for tasting a few if you wish. On top of that the staff is very professional and friendly and music is an electic mix from modern soul to old school heavy metal. I shall be back soon."},

A glass of prosecco soon arrived and then we proceeded to sample three white and three red wines (100ml of each), all excellent - and accompanied by a HUGE sharing board of meats and cheeses specially selected to complement the wines. All finished off with tiramisu and limoncello! Incredible value and quality, with friendly and knowledgeable service. Frederica provided just the right amount of information and tasting notes, with none of the precociousness of some more formal tastings. A fantastic evening experience for couples or friends, highly recommended."},

This restaurant is a student-led commercially-run restaurant designed to deepen the experience of the 16+ year old students at the Orpington Career College focused on the Hospitality and Food industries. Not everything ran completely smoothly, nor did we expect it to. The advertised sauce b\u00e9arnaise did not turn up with the steak, because the b\u00e9arnaise had broken while it was being made - that is the risk you run when students are running the kitchen (shown on the CCTV screen behind us) and when dishes are cooked from scratch. The warm chocolate brownie was tepid at most. However my wife reports it was quite delicious, and my own rump of lamb with red cabbage, potatoes and a parsnip cream was excellent. Indeed the red cabbage was the best I have ever eaten. My glass of Malbec accompanied the lamb brilliantly. This is not a restaurant for those in a hurry; we expected to spent two hours on lunch, and did. But it was very good value at less than \u00a350 for a two-course meal for three with wine, cooked and served by students who were honing their skills."},

I didn't complain on the night as I didn't want to ruin a date with my wife. Maybe they were having a bad night but it will take a lot for me to go back again.

The wine list is small and too bigger gap between a couple of cheapies \u00a319/20 and Primitivo at \u00a332.00. I think a longer and cheaper wine list would be more appropriate for the size of restaurant as for me and my son, the wine is an important constituent of a meal out.

Same was tandoori chicken- smelled looked and tasted old and the meat was greyish and dry.( see pictures below) chicken 65 also the chicken meat was old. Usually this dish is their best one, but the one i got today was really not fresh at all. So i spoke to the restaurant and have given them a direct feedback. First response was reluctant and defensive but after speaking with the chef, the person on the phone apologised and excepted that the marination was at least 2-3 days old.

Very friendly and good atmosphere; it is clearly a favourite with the locals. Had that feel of what pubs used to be like - very much part of the local community. Some good beers and decent wine selection for our meal. Food was good but not as great, as we had expected, having read some of the reviews here on TA. The waitress was terrific and a really engaging person. Dry wit aplenty and very helpful. The only problem (and it was a fairly big issue) is that she was all on her own serving all the tables and so we found ourselves waiting for things we had asked for for quite some time. Water, sauces, napkins.......more staff, please. Prices were as expected for a London pub. A good evening out. Will return."},

Unfortunately, I have more negative comments than positive for this visit. I suppose I was psyching myself for an experience similar to that of dining at Faanoos on the Chiswick High Road as the cuisine seemed comparable. The feeling on arriving at Leila's does make you think you are in for something special but I have to say that although the food was ok it wasn't anything special by a long shot. Bread was uninspiring and the cold Meze starter was lacking flavour and just seemed to be of poor cheap quality. Even the mayonnaise was tasteless and watery! Service wasn't brilliant given that they weren't busy and needed a fair bit of prompting. The mixed kebab meats also lacked flavour and felt like they had been dusted in a spice mix rather then any marinating going on. All a bit frustrating as I'm sure that with just a bit more effort and care plus better ingredients it could be a really fabulous place."},

I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong and in fact, the terrible reviews are very in line with the experience I\u2019ve just had. I am somebody who can\u2019t stand complaining, I find it embarrassing and awkward to do so, but the Iceland style / oven cooked standard of the food was something I couldn\u2019t part with my hard-earned money for. After politely complaining, I was repeatedly challenged by the blonde, female manager (who I now know has been mentioned in other reviews), telling me that the food is freshly cooked and that it was \u2018just my personal taste\u2019, it simply isn\u2019t and wasn\u2019t.

My friend booked a table for my birthday and for many reasons I had a memorable evening. Leila has extended on to the pavement and this area, empty when we visited, would be suitable for watching the world go by. Inside the decor is...er...vaguely Moroccan. In one corner you can dine Moroccan-style on cushions. There's a raised area perhaps used for performances. My guess is that tables have been removed for social distancing purposes. The place was reasonably busy even on a Monday. The couple next to us told us they're regulars. Our Afghani waiter was attentive. He brought us a very palatable bottle of Moroccan white. For our starters we chose olives (\u00a32.95), tabouleh (\u00a34.50) and Leila fried bread and zaatar with sumac, lemon juice and olive oil (\u00a32.95). Unusually for us we finished almost everything. The tabouleh was delicious and went perfectly with the crunchy pieces of fried bread topped with a powder of mixed spices - a first for us. My friend wasn't quite sure he had been served the main he asked for (moussaka, \u00a34.50) but was happy enough with what he'd been given and didn't send it back. My tagine bil lahme (\u00a314.95) - sizzling lamb with prunes, toasted almonds and caramelised onions - was superb. I couldn't finish it and was given a doggy bag. I asked our waiter how old he thought I was and he said 52. This is the thing to tell a 73-year-old. At the end of the meal he brought complimentary baklava with a candle in one piece. I was very impressed. The restaurant also does take-away and Moroccan-themed afternoon tea between 2-5pm daily. The chances are high I'll go back to sample other dishes. Leila is a short walk from Ealing Common tube."},

The people next to us ordered the set Lebanese menu and we will definitely be ordering that next time ... with the tagine! We will definitely be visiting again."},

I had called ahead to check the Welsh game was on, unfortunately we were told it wasn't which was fine we would have tried the Bloomsbury another day...BUT I then had a call from the landlady (owner)r saying she had made a mistake and \"Yes\" the Rugby would be on, talk about going the extra mile for your customers-I was blown away by this. We of course went there & had a great few hours and loved chatting to the owners about the decor, food etc. The food look FAB but we already had plans for the Saturday evening,however we went back this Friday to try the Fish & Chips we were not disappointed it was Excellent!!!!

The skin was nice and chewy with a flavourful interior, you can taste that they are homemade unlike many other chains! Although the Nasi Lemak didn\u2019t have as much flavour as those I have had previously it was very good (I\u2019m just being extra picky haha).

The food is amazing here, it's a local venue to us, the staff are friendly, and on the wedding side of things, many things were included that other venues charged a bomb for, and you could make it more bespoke to you as well. Christine (who runs the event side of things I believe) has years of experience, knows great wedding contacts, has great ideas and makes sure you have thought of everything (I had never planned a wedding before!). For example, we chose not to have seat covers as the chairs are lovely there, but switched the rectangle tables for circular tables (better for guests' conversations) for a cost that was so worth it. We had a DJ and a band, and they liaised well with Christine. Both Christine and Lisa were happy for us to call and check things/ask questions and when we met or chatted to them, nothing was stressful or rushed and she helped us a great deal. We chose the food we preferred for our guests (with vegetarian, vegan, GF and DF options too), talked through the drinks and buffet options and the day went so well. We have since eaten in the restaurant a few times in between lockdowns and they are adhering to government guidance and the food still tastes amazing of course!!! We are so grateful to the Cranleigh team and we would highly recommend this venue for either a meal out or an event."},

As we complained to the manager he said to us \u201cmainly white people come here so we have our food plain, you should of asked if you wanted it spicy\u201d which was a surprise to us because if they make their food so plain to adhere to their customers that should of been mentioned whilst ordering but the argument wasn\u2019t even the food is plain the food was sweet.

When you enter the restaurant, you can see the whole process of making pizzas. We were seated straight away in a lovely back area of the restaurant. We decided to have starters, Caprese salad and prosciutto bruschetta. The pizzas that followed were absolutely delicious and very big. I have not had such an amazing pizza in a while. The service was great, both girls working that night were very pleasant and they made sure that we were comfortable. We have also decided to try their homemade ice cream which was the best, I\u2019ve tried chocolate and my husband had raspberry crunch. We\u2019ve thought the final bill was reasonable, \u00a344 really isn\u2019t bad for what we\u2019ve received. We certainly recommend The Fireball to anyone who wants to have a chilled out evening and some delicious food. We will definitely return again when we are down South. Thanks. "},

Firstly the place was empty. The Waitress did not greet us with a hello or Welcome. She was busy listening to music which drowned the place out that I had to ask her to turn it down so my family could even have a conversation. Clearly there was 3 of us when she dropped 2 menus on the table still no greetings. I had to walk to the bar to pick up a menu for myself. She then took our order for Starters and Mains which on the menu states Starters. She then brings all the food out together which I then asked her why have you brought the main course out with the starters. At this point 3 other people walked out due to rudeness without even ordering. She then shouted if you don't like it leave which we did without even eating a thing. Worst experience ever my 17 daughter was horrified by her behaviour and attitude.Never going back."},

Trying to find it again, I asked around but people mistakenly told me that it was closed, but nevertheless today I went to the main Edgware Restaurant with two of my cousins and we were in awe of the traditional quality of the spectacular food. Although not strictly kosher, it epitomises classic traditional old fashioned Jewish cuisine, Whereas most other Jewish restaurants these days tend to do middle eastern type food rather than timeless dishes like these. Since Blooms closed down, there is nowhere to go for decent chicken soup and matzoh balls, kreplach, chopped liver, hot salt beef, tongue, viennas, and all the classic vintage Hebrew delights that I so loved while growing up. This wonderful restaurant run by John and his sister in law, Gina brings back the taste of my youth, the fondly remembered delicacies of yester year.. Everything is perfect, the incredible service dished up with warmth and charisma, the taste of the food, which dances a tango on your taste buds, the best salt beef outside of the Stage Deli in New York. Blooms was never perfect and its memory pales into insignificance when compared to this truly rare find. Whatever else do do, try the hot salt beef sanwich - WOW - indescribable.

What more suitable than an up-market Fish n' Chippie? The meal was a disappointment. I had a Whitebait starter that I had to send back because the fish were leathery and chewy. They gave me a fresh serving but the fish were in the same condition. so were not eaten. I'm informed by a fish merchant that the probable reason why it was like this was that it had been kept too long and had lost its tone. So the main arrived - Cod & Chips. The cod was unfortunately dry and not in the least moist and succulent. I used quite a lot of tomato sauce to moisten it."},

We had an excellent glass of champagne whilst ordering ......and we quickly demolished the excellent brown sour-dough bread (and ordered more). My partner had scallops, which turned out to be a single gignormous scallop, expertly cooked + foam; I had wild duck with an intense sauce. Mains were roast & lamb - sounds plain but the flavours were incredibly intense with interesting accompaniments........and more than adequate portion size. For dessert, I had a gorgeous choclatey thing whilst my partner had an apple pie souffle - probably the best thing on the dessert menu. Washed down with an excellent Aussie Shiraz......and accompanied with a cognac for me and a dessert wine for her. For most mortals, this isn't the sort of place to visit for a casual weekend meal out - it's a special deal for the palate and the wallet.....but well worth it."},

Donata greeted us at the door and took our temperatures (reassuring in these strange times!). She\u2019s expecting a baby boy in November so good luck for that - I told her boys were exhausting but very worth it! A lovely round table sparkling with cutlery and glasses - very pretty. We were served a little ravioli as an amuse-bouche, in addition to the five-course tasting menu, which was very tasty. We stuck with red wine throughout the meal - a very drinkable Mas de Vigneron. Bread was absolutely delicious and we asked for more, mainly the chorizo one. Next course was tuna - I\u2019ve never eaten it so rare but it was absolutely delicious, melt-in-the-mouth, and the avocado/watermelon salsa was a tasty surprise. Then the most beautiful work of art - a terrine of rabbit and ham hock with the most delicious tarragon jelly and plum chutney and the pistachios in the terrine were a fantastic nutty surprise along with the delicious walnut toast. Absolutely delicious. Cod to follow with a gorgeous chorizo crust, cooked to perfection with a smooth cauliflower pur\u00e9e and lovely rainbow chard - couldn\u2019t fault it. Venison was next with a lovely granola of cranberry and nuts, beautiful pommes Anna and a yum celeriac pur\u00e9e - the juniper berry jus brought it all together so wonderfully. Not sure where the blueberry sorbet came, with a light crumble, could\u2019ve been before the venison - delicious and extra again to the five courses (made seven courses in all!) The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was a triumph with a beautiful little ball of vanilla parfait within a chocolate shell. This was just so very good - superb quality ingredients, cooked to absolute perfection and some quite different combinations which were both surprising and delicious!!!! Combined with my lovely family, I was just in heaven - the perfect meal. Estelle our waitress, and Donata also, looked after us so attentively but unobtrusively. This place is fantastic!! Can\u2019t praise it highly enough - thank you chefs, just superb and just can\u2019t wait to come back for another tasting menu!!! Apologies for only two pictures - I was having such a very good time I couldn\u2019t bear to stop and take pictures - a very good excuse to go back but I did get a snap of the terrine which I think was my absolute favourite course."},

The waitress was friendly and answered the questions that we had for her. My mother had dish 96 (I cant remember the name of the dish) it was a anchovy fried rice and it was out of this world, I have never tasted something like it. If you're a seafood lover and love a bit of spice you'd love this dish!! (I had about a third of her dish ahaha:P ). I had a masala dosa which tasted amazing and the green coconut chutney that it came with was mouth watering!! My little brother had butter chicken and roti, and the roti was amazing with the curry. Every single dish we had tasted incredible. The chef also came and had a chat with us and asked us how we found the food. We gave our compliments and saw the passion he had for cooking this treat. We all had milk hoppers at the end, which honestly was out of this world. I cannot stress this enough, this restaurant is absolutely amazing.

After being tired of visiting the same local restaurants over and over, I decided to take to tripadvisor and see what hidden gems were in Harrow to make a suitable booking for a quite and cosy meal with my parents for my 25th birthday. When looking at the reviews I was a bit of a sceptic, it seemed very strange to see a restaurant with such high reviews, BUT, to my surprise, hand on heart, they lived up to their word. Our server was a young lady that made an exceptional job of making sure we felt happy and went above and beyond to satisfy our needs. The food was fresh and delicious, and the ambience of the restaurant was perfect, not crowded or congested, Italian music playing, but not too loud, a well lit room, not too dark and not to bright! The experience as a whole was delightful. With the heatwave we experienced at the start of August you could\u2019ve sworn that you where on a promenade in Italy with the perfect environment of the restaurant, gentle music playing and rustic food. I really have to take my hat off to our server, even though we were only a party of 3, she really wanted to go the extra mile when she found out it was my birthday, she insisted I have a complimentary desert, and after a little sweetening I gave in and took her up on her offer. The dessert was a perfectly balanced strawberry cheesecake with a champagne jelly, it was exceptional and surprisingly light after having quite a heavy and rich meal, and made a perfect end to my meal. I highly recommend SENSI, anyone in the area or visiting, you will not be disappointed! Thank you for a pleasant experience; I hope to visit again in the not to distant future :)"},

My boyfriend whose birthday we were celebrating last night praised his Churrasco de Lomo as the best steak he has ever had. He woke up this morning already planning when do we go again. My order of a fillet/tenderloin was delicious too. Highly recommend their sauces, all are booming with flavour.

The service is great, staff are smiling and always try to do all possible to ensure guests are happy. It is a great place to find a lovely dinner and spend a nice time with a friend, the family or other half- perfect for all occasions. I really recommend it."},

It\u2019s sweet and the meat was tender so you didn\u2019t find yourself chewing too much. I can\u2019t take spicy food but my partner said they enjoyed their food. The shrimp fried rice can be shared between two people so it\u2019s worth the price. What I will say is that we found ourselves not finishing our food and taking it home instead because the dishes can be shared between two people (depending on how much you eat - or maybe we both just don\u2019t eat a lot), so again worth the price. We left the restaurant with half of both of our dishes left over and the restaurant was kind enough to give us a container for this. The grilled dumplings were decent but we both agreed best dish from what we had on the table is definitely the Sliced Beef Chinese Style. Service is great - we didn\u2019t have to wait too long for our food to arrive, about 10-15 mins but best part are the workers who were very nice to us and I enjoyed speaking to them. I would recommend this restaurant, plus it\u2019s not too expensive"},

The owner and the staff were very welcoming, very friendly to talk to and very helpful and charismatic, the food was to die for! You could taste that everything was freshly made, the food came out very quick, we had starters, mains, desserts and 2rounds of drinks in less than an hour! I've never been to any restaurant that served food that quick. The food was very well presented and tasted as good as it looked and my god was it absolutely delicious. We had the Tangine marrakech & Mechoui for mains and it was the best I've ever had. You can tell that every dish that comes out was heartfelt in this small family run business and everyone behind this restaurant are putting their hearts into everything they are doing. The food price is surprisingly very reasonable. I thought because of the location they might be expensive but that is not the case. I highly recommend, and will definitely will be going back. P.s the owner bought us a drink just because we travelled 2hours just to come eat at his restaurant and travelling another 2 hours back. That was really kind and appreciative of him. **The best restaurant we've ever been to** This wasn't just good food. It was an experience. "},

Silly me. It is pretty well booked up all the time and you need to book in advance. We were going back to visit kew Gardens Christmas lights last weekend so we decided to book here on one of our nights. There is no menu, and no prices, but not knowing what you were going to eat was all part of the charm. Very small cosy restaurant, 38 covers, and so you do sit in very close proximity to others but again no worries. The owner invites you in sits you down and gives you a little information as to what to expect and take your drinks order. We had house wine, which was the cheapest option at \u00a330, but was very pleasant anyway. I fancied a beer and the 'artisan' beer was recommended. it was a 75cl bottle and was lovely so I had another one!! The food was amazing, we lost count of number of courses but they were all good, different and very tasty. The main course was a succulent piece of pork. This was a great fun night, great food, nice atmosphere, great beer, good wine and all in all a great night out. I would highly recommend booking to go here and can not wait to go back. 'Artisan' beer, \u00a315 per bottle. I am glad I enjoyed it so much. The house wine as I say was \u00a330 per bottle and the meal was \u00a360 per head and well worth every penny."},

Vegetables were non existent and you claim on the menu that you have the 'best potatoes in Barnet' sorry not even close.

For \u00a317.95 the roast beef really was substandard. My beef was ridiculously fatty and my partner's was cold. The Yorkshire puddings were covered in grease and the gravy was so thin it was see through! In all fairness, I did enjoy the mixed vegetables and roast potatoes (although they are definitely not the best in Barnet; The Gate has better). The service was hit and miss, it certainly didn't warrant the service charge added. We would have mentioned our disappointment to the management but it was difficult enough just to grab someone's attention for the bill. \u00a343.12 for two poor quality roasts and a large bottle of water."},

I am delighted to report the quality of the food was superb. The skill in the kitchen was undeniable and the presentation as one would expect in a fine dining establishment, which are few and far between in the area. The table service was highly professional and attentive without being claustrophobic. To be honest, neither of us are fans of tasting menus but it was the only choice on the evening. However, each course was delicious. There is no avoiding the fact that the restaurant has been created within an open space, and when looking up, hotel floors are visible. It is a shame it is not a conventional room where a more intimate atmosphere would be easier to achieve. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening and will return soon."},

The Pizzas were fine, however the pasta we ordered was their special. Turned up with 2 small pieces of prawn and that it... some bland spaghetti. I was appalled to see 2 small prawns in there, felt like they were having a laugh. So phoned them and fed back straight away. Owner answers call and doesn\u2019t take any ownership - most hilarious thing was that she blamed the delivery driver. I can assure you - no manipulation with the boxes it most certainly was not the delivery driver. The chef and owner should have just taken some ownership here and apologised which they failed to do. Doubt I\u2019d be ordering from there anymore - food ordered won\u2019t be consistent every time. Real shame. "},

We all really enjoyed the food so we were looking forward to eating in the restaurant once it reopened. We\u2019ve eaten here a few times now (once in the last week) and we have all tried something different from the menu each time - 2adults & 2children, I can personally recommend the mussels, the garlic bread (topped with tomato sauce) and the seafood pasta. The food is of good quality and seriously tasty. The portion sizes and prices are also good. The staff are friendly and helpful but not intrusive. Not one complaint. A new family favourite. Looking forward to going again :)"},

I ate the Les Complete (Buckwheat pancake with egg, cheese and ham), followed by the Cr\u00eape au Nutella - with extra ice cream. Both were superb and delicious. My wife ate the Galette au Roquefort (Buckwheat pancake with onion sauce, celery, walnuts and Roquefort sauce), followed by Crepe Normande (apples and salty caramel sauce). I washed it down with a very good glass of Largesse 2017 Merlot (Pays d\u2019Oc), and my wife particularly commented on how good her Kir Royal was. All for \u00a327 per head, including 12.5% Service.

My 4 year old grand daughter had paper to draw on a special drink and her pasta before we had ordered and both of them were totally looked after from start to finish. The lovely waitress even noticed that my grand daughter's hair was getting in her pasta and brought her a hair bobble! The food was delicious. Fast service but we didn't feel rushed at all. Lovely wine and beer and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The manager was incredible. Super suggestions for food and made my grand daughter feel so special - even pinning her picture up on the wall and taking her into the kitchen. By far and way the least stressful meal out we have ever had with the 2 kids but also one of the nicest meals I have had too. My husbands birthday is January and we will definitely be back then if not before."},

We went inside and ordered a plate of kulcha , it was a family visit to enjoy Dushera but they actually spoiled our day and I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. This is a family restaurant, but not really. We went inside and ordered plate of kulcha , but he never bothered to listen anything and on his own he got the takeaway. We were hungry and wanted to eat and go , but yes the man he was more interested in cleaning and decided to give the takeaway on his own . Moreover even for the takeaway it took them while to get the takeaway.When we said we are here for dinning as we were already waiting for the food to come , ok she now he decided to serve the food from the takeaway packet only but not bothered to serve fresh one . We decided to eat kulcha fresh over there , crispy but instead it was very soggy and cold , as if we got the lunch box from home and eating there .Now when he is aware that we are eating there , he never bothered to ask if we need drinks really, is that how you serve the food during this pandemic time , cold food and horrible taste . Butter was also melting on that small tiny bread . The lady and the man who were serving there , they were very rude and ill mannered. Both of them need training. You appoint students to work there , but no training. I felt like as if I am eating for free ,Paid \u00a310 for small soggy tiny bread really horrible. We will never recommend any one to go there , very rude impolite staff . When we go to India in Amritsar , in brothers dhabha, that\u2019s the kulcha we eat there and the service they give is awesome."},

Somehow Eric and his team have managed to reproduce the excellence of their cuisine in one's own home - and the meal was a great lifter of our spirits during lockdown. The skilful mix of ingredients made every dish flavoursome and satisfying. Portions are as small as one would expect in a tasting menu, but we added a cheese platter (one between two) and by the time we had eaten that and the rich chocolate dessert we were replete - and decided to save the complimentary petit fours for another day. And all at a price that was very good value for the quality on offer"},

Service is annoying as they keep coming to your table asking you to order more. Food is quite spicy even though we told them to keep the spices down. Drinks are also very overpriced - \u00a311 for a small gin and tonic where the same thing is sold in other restaurants for no more than \u00a36-8. Quite old environment as well. Reception staff fairly rude and very unaccommodating when we asked for a small birthday candle to be put on one of their desserts. The kulfi is the standard pot kulfis that you can get from any shop. Definitely would not be going again and avoid if you can!"},

Loved the cassava and acai bowl. The chef, Caliel, was amazing. He went above and beyond, coming over to explain all the ingredients in the dishes that my father could not eat due to his illness. He then went on to explain any alterations he could make to the dishes to help him, e.g. Gluten free bread. The staff were lovely, Nora and Julia,very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Never had to wait for any service, and it always came with a smile. Even when the restaurant got busy, the girls made sure everyone had their food on time and the water bottles were always full.

The lunch time price has risen under the new owners going from a modest \u00a338 in 2018 to \u00a345 in 2019/20 and I see that it will now be \u00a350 for 4 courses (no choices and no coffee included) in August this year when it re-opens.

Perhaps coffee could be included - a bit pricey as an extra, although very good, and with petit fours. Pity the max table size is 6, but can understand why in an intimate space."},

It was a comfortable place to dine and it didn't feel stuffy like some Michelin restaurants do! From the appetiser to the bread, fish and dessert, it was delicious. Both my boyfriend and I are pescatarian and there was an option for us at every course. There is also a vegetarian menu as well. Well worth the money and I would love to return, thank you."},

I had poached eggs and smoked salmon on muffin with avocado and it was delicious. The food is always first rate, presented beautifully - a real feast for the eyes. Having drained the coffee machine mercilessly for the first hour (and enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice) we move on to an Orpington Fizz (well, it IS nearly Christmas). The atmosphere was great and we were right by the decorated Xmas tree so felt very festive indeed. Such a shame Tier 3 being imposed again - how are restaurants ever supposed to plan or know where they stand!

We had a wide selection of sharing plates that included the Olive paste, halloumi, squid, prawns and lamb cutlets all generously sized and full of flavour. We had two good bottles of wine and the bill for four was under 150 quid. ridiculously good value."},

This is because of the inspirational and creative manner in which the head chef (and owner) creates dishes which are authentically Cypriot yet also feel contemporary and fresh. Indeed, perhaps it would be fairer to call the food 'Mediterranean ' as the flavours resonate from the Middle East, North Africa and the Greek world too. The menu is small but perfectly formed and every dish we tried was both very familiar yet unique-the kalamari for example was made with an incredibly light batter with a hint of chili and fresh parsley. My favourite of all though were the lamb cutlets-absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. If that wasn't enough, the service was delightful and the bill staggeringly good value. King Street is certainly foodie heaven and now has probably one of the best Cypriot restaurants in London to add to its collection."},

Anyway, ordered 3 starters and 3 mains, naan and a glass of wine for 3 of us. Worked out to around \u00a325 each after discount applied. Food was quite tasty. Could have had a little more depth of flavour but we didn't know until we had ordered it otherwise could have asked for it. Will know to ask that next time. Quantity of food was ok but a little on the low side for my expectation. This was based on the cost of each dish, Felt it is a little over priced for what you get and I've had better flavours in local restaurants that offer better value for money. Maybe because they are a large caterer and heavily advertise, costs have to be covered somewhere. I agree with what people say about the staff. They were courteous and attentive and food was served quickly. Nice atmosphere and COVID measures adhered to so made you feel comfortable. Nice to have tried but at their usual price, I would rather stick to some of the more familiar places I visit when I go to Southall."},

For once, each curry has its own distinctive flavour and blessed with real, fresh ingredients...curry leaves and ginger!! I have worked for the NHS for the last 40+ years and COVID has really taken its toll on us nurses. I enquired with Bombaylicious to see if they were able to donate a few meals for some of our theatre staff for lunch and was delighted when they obliged! Boxes and boxes of hot, fresh, delicious curries!! Our staff were so delighted, everything was snapped up in minutes. An amazing donation to those risking their health on the front line!! Thank you so much!!! From A2 theatre staff at St Helier!!"},

We were not disappointed. I am a great fan of arancini and La Dolce Vita\u2019s were superb. I followed this up with a wonderful mixed seafood spaghetti. Also impressive was the performance of Luca, who, single-handedly maintained an efficient service in a room where all the tables were taken, all the while dealing with the constant demand for takeaway meals. He allowed me to try out my Italian on him and made the occupants of each table feel that they were the most interesting and amusing people in the room."},

It was a really gloomy day but the patio area is really great - comfortable and well set up. We look forward to returning after confinement."},
