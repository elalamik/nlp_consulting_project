We usually like to dine in as we love the atmosphere and the staff are very accommodating for our three children. We have had to settle for takeouts during the lockdown but the quality of the food remains the same always arriving hot and on time. Staff remembers me when I call so makes it personal and welcoming. I have even used their app to order which is so simple to navigate. Our favourite remains to be the biryani as it\u2019s lightly spiced so perfect for the children and they can\u2019t get enough of it. My personal favourite is the mixed grill as it has everything. Haweli has recently added new grill dishes to the menu which I am slowly working my way through trying. Just want to say a big thank you to Haweli for staying open throughout the lockdown and all their efforts. I will see you guys very soon. "},

I already had my friends saying that they would be visiting Madhu's again. The arrangements made were simply great - the manager, Khush, was very understanding and patient with me as I had a hundred questions - giving him a call everytime for anything I was unsure about prior to the function! Also, had a guest who had gluten and dairy allergy and the team were understanding and made sure that guest was aware of the ingredients in the dishes. All the guests were very well looked after and catered for. All the arrangements made were discussed with me and then finalised. "},

Incredibly delicious and cooked to a very high quality. I personally recommend the mixed grill, the lamb chops are fantastic - the other grilled options are incredibly tasty too! The staff are fantastic at Haweli as well, always very welcoming whether that's on the phone or in person - we cannot wait to go back after lockdown. Even during lockdown, our food has been delivered punctually and to a very high standard.

We went inside and ordered a plate of kulcha , it was a family visit to enjoy Dushera but they actually spoiled our day and I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. This is a family restaurant, but not really. We went inside and ordered plate of kulcha , but he never bothered to listen anything and on his own he got the takeaway. We were hungry and wanted to eat and go , but yes the man he was more interested in cleaning and decided to give the takeaway on his own . Moreover even for the takeaway it took them while to get the takeaway.When we said we are here for dinning as we were already waiting for the food to come , ok she now he decided to serve the food from the takeaway packet only but not bothered to serve fresh one . We decided to eat kulcha fresh over there , crispy but instead it was very soggy and cold , as if we got the lunch box from home and eating there .Now when he is aware that we are eating there , he never bothered to ask if we need drinks really, is that how you serve the food during this pandemic time , cold food and horrible taste . Butter was also melting on that small tiny bread . The lady and the man who were serving there , they were very rude and ill mannered. Both of them need training. You appoint students to work there , but no training. I felt like as if I am eating for free ,Paid \u00a310 for small soggy tiny bread really horrible. We will never recommend any one to go there , very rude impolite staff . When we go to India in Amritsar , in brothers dhabha, that\u2019s the kulcha we eat there and the service they give is awesome."},

She then brings all the food out together which I then asked her why have you brought the main course out with the starters. At this point 3 other people walked out due to rudeness without even ordering. She then shouted if you don't like it leave which we did without even eating a thing. Worst experience ever my 17 daughter was horrified by her behaviour and attitude.Never going back."},

The lunch time price has risen under the new owners going from a modest \u00a338 in 2018 to \u00a345 in 2019/20 and I see that it will now be \u00a350 for 4 courses (no choices and no coffee included) in August this year when it re-opens.

I can honestly say it was the best meal we have ever had. Tony Parkin and his team were fantastic, great service and even greater food. It was a comfortable place to dine and it didn't feel stuffy like some Michelin restaurants do! From the appetiser to the bread, fish and dessert, it was delicious. Both my boyfriend and I are pescatarian and there was an option for us at every course. There is also a vegetarian menu as well. Well worth the money and I would love to return, thank you."},

Anyway, ordered 3 starters and 3 mains, naan and a glass of wine for 3 of us. Worked out to around \u00a325 each after discount applied. Food was quite tasty. Could have had a little more depth of flavour but we didn't know until we had ordered it otherwise could have asked for it. Will know to ask that next time. Quantity of food was ok but a little on the low side for my expectation. This was based on the cost of each dish, Felt it is a little over priced for what you get and I've had better flavours in local restaurants that offer better value for money. Maybe because they are a large caterer and heavily advertise, costs have to be covered somewhere. I agree with what people say about the staff. They were courteous and attentive and food was served quickly. Nice atmosphere and COVID measures adhered to so made you feel comfortable. Nice to have tried but at their usual price, I would rather stick to some of the more familiar places I visit when I go to Southall."},

Tables are separated by clear Perspex sheets, which in no way felt intrusive or destructive the lively atmosphere of this stylish, local Thai restaurant. Keep up the good work Awesome Thai - it\u2019s great to have you fully open again!"},

The staff go above and beyond to interact with customers, even though the COVID pandemic is happening. They make you feel at home, they welcome you with a smile and they treat you like their own. The drinks are extremely cheap and worth the price. The entire atmosphere in a nutshell, is a stimulating experience. I would like to give a shout-out to Ash, she was incredible. Polite, well mannered and a joy to be around. During such a hard time in the world, she is still able to keep a smile on her face and enjoy her job. Customer service is about putting customers first and Ash did exactly that. WELL DONE!!"},

I popped in there on Tuesday just before Tier 3 returned to have a meeting with my financial advisor and we stayed four hours! Always get a lovely warm welcome from Scott and his team. I had poached eggs and smoked salmon on muffin with avocado and it was delicious. The food is always first rate, presented beautifully - a real feast for the eyes. Having drained the coffee machine mercilessly for the first hour (and enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice) we move on to an Orpington Fizz (well, it IS nearly Christmas). The atmosphere was great and we were right by the decorated Xmas tree so felt very festive indeed. Such a shame Tier 3 being imposed again - how are restaurants ever supposed to plan or know where they stand! Delighted to hear they're going to trial a take-away service and look forward to supporting them further through this challenging time. Merry Christmas to everyone at the Orpington and loving your 'Keep Calm & Carry On' attitude!"},

Donata greeted us at the door and took our temperatures (reassuring in these strange times!). She\u2019s expecting a baby boy in November so good luck for that - I told her boys were exhausting but very worth it! A lovely round table sparkling with cutlery and glasses - very pretty. We were served a little ravioli as an amuse-bouche, in addition to the five-course tasting menu, which was very tasty. We stuck with red wine throughout the meal - a very drinkable Mas de Vigneron. Bread was absolutely delicious and we asked for more, mainly the chorizo one. Next course was tuna - I\u2019ve never eaten it so rare but it was absolutely delicious, melt-in-the-mouth, and the avocado/watermelon salsa was a tasty surprise. Then the most beautiful work of art - a terrine of rabbit and ham hock with the most delicious tarragon jelly and plum chutney and the pistachios in the terrine were a fantastic nutty surprise along with the delicious walnut toast. Absolutely delicious. Cod to follow with a gorgeous chorizo crust, cooked to perfection with a smooth cauliflower pur\u00e9e and lovely rainbow chard - couldn\u2019t fault it. Venison was next with a lovely granola of cranberry and nuts, beautiful pommes Anna and a yum celeriac pur\u00e9e - the juniper berry jus brought it all together so wonderfully. Not sure where the blueberry sorbet came, with a light crumble, could\u2019ve been before the venison - delicious and extra again to the five courses (made seven courses in all!) The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was a triumph with a beautiful little ball of vanilla parfait within a chocolate shell. This was just so very good - superb quality ingredients, cooked to absolute perfection and some quite different combinations which were both surprising and delicious!!!! Combined with my lovely family, I was just in heaven - the perfect meal. Estelle our waitress, and Donata also, looked after us so attentively but unobtrusively. This place is fantastic!! Can\u2019t praise it highly enough - thank you chefs, just superb and just can\u2019t wait to come back for another tasting menu!!! Apologies for only two pictures - I was having such a very good time I couldn\u2019t bear to stop and take pictures - a very good excuse to go back but I did get a snap of the terrine which I think was my absolute favourite course."},

After a chat with the staff it is clear that sourcing most of the ingredients direct from specific, trusted (maybe family?) suppliers in Cyprus is key. We had a wide selection of sharing plates that included the Olive paste, halloumi, squid, prawns and lamb cutlets all generously sized and full of flavour. We had two good bottles of wine and the bill for four was under 150 quid. ridiculously good value."},

This is because of the inspirational and creative manner in which the head chef (and owner) creates dishes which are authentically Cypriot yet also feel contemporary and fresh. Indeed, perhaps it would be fairer to call the food 'Mediterranean ' as the flavours resonate from the Middle East, North Africa and the Greek world too. The menu is small but perfectly formed and every dish we tried was both very familiar yet unique-the kalamari for example was made with an incredibly light batter with a hint of chili and fresh parsley. My favourite of all though were the lamb cutlets-absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. If that wasn't enough, the service was delightful and the bill staggeringly good value. King Street is certainly foodie heaven and now has probably one of the best Cypriot restaurants in London to add to its collection."},

Somehow Eric and his team have managed to reproduce the excellence of their cuisine in one's own home - and the meal was a great lifter of our spirits during lockdown. The skilful mix of ingredients made every dish flavoursome and satisfying. Portions are as small as one would expect in a tasting menu, but we added a cheese platter (one between two) and by the time we had eaten that and the rich chocolate dessert we were replete - and decided to save the complimentary petit fours for another day. And all at a price that was very good value for the quality on offer"},

All I can say is I\u2019ve had food from here 6-7 times in the last 2-3 months and it is the best curry I have had outside of India, and possibly even better than the curry I had in Leela Palace in Bangalore. Which was out of this world! I can safely say this is my new favourite take away and it will take something special to come between me and Bombaylicious now "},
