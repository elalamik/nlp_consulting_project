Mediocre Indian food wrapped up as \"Fine Dining\". Small expensive portions, untrained staff and bland food. My suggestion? Jump in a cab travel 1 mile to Hounslow West and savour the best Indian Food in West London. Authentic, full of rich flavours at one third of the price. Madhus chefs cook anglicised food which lacks the subtle yet full flavours of spices that makes Indian food unique. It was actually someone we were chatting to over breakfast in the hotel who suggested we give Madhus a miss as they had eaten there the night before. So glad we took their advice!"}

Warm welcome at the entrance and whilst strict COVID requirements were in place ( ie contact details , hand sanitising , temperatures checked and spacing ) we were nevertheless greeted with a cordial and efficient process and treated as a valued guest . Tables were well spaced out , and all serving staff were suitably masked .  Food was it\u2019s usual high standard , I can certainly vouch for the vegetarian options of paneer tikka , soft and flavoursome , harra barra kebab equally good , assortment of popadoms with fresh chutneys and my guests from the USA were highly complimentary about the mixed grill platter .  Mains and a selection of breads were once again on point , as always generous portions , served piping hot , not too oily or spicy , salt levels perfect and all dishes were distinct in look and flavours , hard to pick a stand out dish , but the Punjabi Khadi just got to the winning post.  The meal wouldn\u2019t ha e been complete without dessert and we were spoilt for choice with a delightful trio of Gajjar Halwa , Gulab Jamun and Kulfi . Service was subtle and professional , plenty of staff on hand , and nothing was too much trouble , any ad hoc requests met with a smile . All in all an top marks and look forward to a return visit soon"}

Was fairly quiet and no one was being rushed.  Had made a booking so got seated fairly promptly.  For our mains me and my wife asked for our curries to be made extra extra spicy. The waiter said that he would bring extra green chillies on the side rather then making the curry extra extra spicy like we requested to which we said no and asked for the curry to have extra chillies in it instead; he agreed to have it made this way. Were our curries extra extra spicy? No, not at all. Maybe they were for the chef but my Paneer Butter Masala tasted sweet more like a Butter Chicken and my wife Paneer dish was was also very mild. Very disappointed with the food today and glad that I don't come here on a regular basis as there are far better places elsewhere. Also not once did anyone come to ask if the food (starters and mains) were fine but did ask me, only when passing by, whether I wanted another beer.  I'll probably get the same copy and pasted reply from the manager apologising and telling me that they would love to see me again next time.  No thanks, you don't run that great a place. "}

Starters came one at a time so we could not enjoy the selection. Ordered a milkshake for my child never arrived, by this time I complained again and finally got a waiter who was much better and got our mains order correct, it arrived cold but by that time I had given up. I have never experienced such poor behaviour and lack of hospitality when you are paying premium prices.

Not only was the outside area well protected from the elements and well heated but the tables were spaced out and all the waiters wore masks appropriately. The food was delicious and the pudding was fab, especially when they brought mine out with a candle in and sang a personal happy birthday. Would definitely recommend."}

We were not disappointed. I am a great fan of arancini and La Dolce Vita\u2019s were superb. I followed this up with a wonderful mixed seafood spaghetti. Also impressive was the performance of Luca, who, single-handedly maintained an efficient service in a room where all the tables were taken, all the while dealing with the constant demand for takeaway meals. He allowed me to try out my Italian on him and made the occupants of each table feel that they were the most interesting and amusing people in the room."}

Having not been here we visited last Thursday and I have to say was very surprised! The restaurant was spacious and we were greeted by front of house management Eric Cardozo very warmly and served to a very high standard by Malcolm Martins. Food of high quality and good standard - nice presentation and most importantly lovely tasting! Whilst dining there was also a promotional photo sheet in the corner taking place and we whilst talking to the owner were also invited to taste which was an especially nice thing of management! Unfortunately having already eaten lunch I had to refrain from being over gluttonous and had to decline although my parents had a taste of some of the delightful dishes on offer! Special mention again to Malcolm who served to the highest standards and Eric who checked in a few time during the meal and ensured we were happy and everything was satisfactory. Looking forward to visiting soon and thank you for a wonderful afternoon lunch with delicious food! Ps had to post a pic of the lovely food which was layed out for their promo shoot!"}

This is not the best place if you have a shellfish or nut allergy and also not very accommodating when you ask of they can change dishes for people who have the allergies. So most of the meats and shellfish are cooked on the same grill. Which means anyone with a shellfish allergy cant have meat. Wonder if they tell the pescatarians that there fish dishes are cooked on the same grill as the chicken?? Hmmmm The mains are hit and miss some with nuts and some not. Personally not the most accommodating and don't think I would go back."}

Unfortunately we did not have the same experiences as its reviews. The food was okay - their fry up was quite average but okay if a traditional fry up is what you want. The problem was the complete lack of hygiene especially post-pandemic.  The inside of the cafe was packed, with about half a metre of space between each table. Between diners, tables were wiped (with the most simplistic definition of the term) - no anti-bac spray, chairs weren't cleaned, salt and pepper not wiped down etc. None of the staff were wearing masks but they had no hesitation to get within one metre of you to take your order. I can't know for sure and it was busy so perhaps there wasn't always time, but I didn't see any staff stop to wash their hands or apply anti-bac gel. Then they'd hand you your knife and fork. It wasn't a bad spot for a quick or cheap meal but I wouldn't recommend due to their lack of hygiene and lack of consideration towards the current climate."}

Loved the cassava and acai bowl. The chef, Caliel, was amazing. He went above and beyond, coming over to explain all the ingredients in the dishes that my father could not eat due to his illness. He then went on to explain any alterations he could make to the dishes to help him, e.g. Gluten free bread. The staff were lovely, Nora and Julia,very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Never had to wait for any service, and it always came with a smile. Even when the restaurant got busy, the girls made sure everyone had their food on time and the water bottles were always full. Tables were cleaned as soon as the last person finished eating. Amazing hospitality. Overall I would highly recommended this restaurant, very welcoming.

It ticked all the boxes for us as one of our party was vegan and one vegetarian. Service was excellent and we appreciated the warm greeting and goodbye from the manageress. The vibe is cosy and chic, with lots of hanging plants from repurposed pallets and a funky open kitchen flanked by clusters of exotic fruits and vegetables from where you can watch proprietor / head chef Emerson Am\u00e9lio de Oliveira work his magic. We had: Starters: Faux Gras. Mandoo. Pumpkin salad.  Mains : Truffled Striata. White Spice. Strozzapreti. Zucchini Fritters side. Deserts: Fudge. Trio of sorbets (kindly on the house as\u00a0we had a birthday) Drinks: Adobe organic Chardonnay. 1 Sacred vodka, and a glass of Fior de Cassia Prosecco for the birthday girl. Everything on the menu looked great and worth revisiting for, but we were more than happy with our various choices. Standouts were the starters - Faux Gras, a vegan riff on the, let\u2019s face it, guilt-inducing but delicious carnivorous original, was silky in texture with an earthy density from the mushroom base, topped with a cool slab of rich vegan butter nicely challenged by the sharp notes of a home-made piccalilli - and Mandoo - Korean dim sum stuffed with Kimchi which our vegan daughter devoured in seconds with a big smile.  The Zucchini fritters with pumpkin chilli sauce were also fantastic and glad we ordered them as the \u2018White spice\u2019 main although being smothered in a lively aged parmesan, risked becoming a touch samey after a while. Chocolate was mentioned in the ingredients but the sweetness it afforded the diced root vegetables was perhaps a little lost under the cheese - nonetheless it was a very welcome comfort dish to thaw us out on a freezing wintry night (we had recklessly walked from home in Kew) and with the extra crunch of the zucchini and chilli spice side, it rocked.  Desserts were awesome - dark Amazonian chocolate Fudge with Bourbon vanilla ice cream, both light and intense - and a trio of Amazonian rare super fruit sorbets (A\u00e7a\u00ed \u2013 Cupua\u00e7u \u2013 Pitaya) which we customised with a dash of 'sacred' vodka to supercharge the exotic flavours, really hit the spot.  For us, the test of a new restaurant is that you're talking about the food the next day, and the next. In a good way, of course. This was definitely the case here and we look forward to returning for brunch, dinner or both, soon.\u2028"}

HOWEVER I will not be going back after my last encounter with them. This particular day I called to make a reservation as it was a Friday night - I was told in no uncertain terms that I could not book just to just show up and 'walk in'. I was concerned saying I didn't want to drive all that way on a Friday evening to find no table available. \"NO\" not an option the voice on the other end of the phone was emphatic. OK so I thought we would go early and hope for the best. My daughter and I arrived about 6.45pm and were met with that same attitude (I think the same person) as the person I spoke to on the phone. We were greeted us with \"Have you booked?\" in a very aggressive and unwelcoming tone. I reminded her we had spoken on the phone earlier and had been told just to show up. She told me I should have booked online and that I would have had to pay a deposit to do this (I was not told this on the phone, so news to me) She offered us a small table in the entrance-way by the front door, not in the main restaurant room. We declined as the atmosphere we were met with was icy and unpleasant and we didn't want to eat with that hanging around. It is not only the food I go out for but the welcome, warm atmosphere and a sense that my host actually wants me there. Needless to say we will never return.  I am in the service industry and it is very shortsighted to treat your customers this way - however your day has been or whatever is going on."}
