We asked if we can go into the shisha garden and was told it was first come first serve which I think should definitely be changed into a booking thing as it\u2019s not fair for those that have literally come to do shisha. We were promised by multiple staff that they will get us into shisha and an hour later - still nothing. We ordered our drinks which were a simple soft drink and had to wait a good half an hour for them, the staff were quite busy but not as attentive as I hoped. The music was poor. Social distancing did not exist. It\u2019s a shame because in the past I\u2019ve heard good things about this place but by the looks of the latest reviews, it\u2019s gone seriously downhill.

My boyfriend whose birthday we were celebrating last night praised his Churrasco de Lomo as the best steak he has ever had. He woke up this morning already planning when do we go again. My order of a fillet/tenderloin was delicious too. Highly recommend their sauces, all are booming with flavour.

Most of the hotels on the Bath Road are better known for their functionality rather than their style. Having stayed at the Skyline in the past, I was surprised to find that it now has a very decent Indian restaurant. A Dutch friend of mine was staying at the Holiday Inn, so we walked down the road to give Madhu's a try based on its TripAdvisor ratings. It is a large restaurant, catering for both hotel guests and visitors. As with many hotel restaurants, they never quite lose the sense that they are providing a mass service, so it's not somewhere I would come for an intimate tete a tete.  That said, the service was efficient and attentive. We were delivered our pints of Cobra and a tray laden with a mix of popadums. These seemed to be a curious variety of mini-popadums and rice crackers, but were duly dispatched. The curse of popadums is that they can become chewy when not completely fresh, but there was no risk of that. We each ordered the thalis - one meat, one veggie - and there was more than enough food to have us staggering from the table at the end. It was all freshly prepared, with some piping hot samosas, naan and a dhal thrown in. I took the vegetarian option, and enjoyed each of the dishes. I'm not normally a fan of paneer, but the saag paneer here was very good, with relatively small chunks of paneer which were not overly chewy. My friend was equally impressed. Clearly this place is targeted at business people and those staying on holiday - either in transit, or because they don't realise that Heathrow is still quite a way from London - and the pricing is correspondingly steep for what you get. Our meal came to close on \u00a350 a head, with only a couple of beers and a bottle of sparkling water. That said, they know their market, cater to it accordingly and who can blame them? I would certainly suggest Madhu's as an option for an informal corporate dinner and would return again.", "date_of_review": "9 November 2018"}

I used to come and eat at this place for diner because I was very pleased by the service. I came back there last week and was surprised to see that some things had changed. Indeed, they used to give all customers a complementary starter before ordering the main dish. That disappeared unfortunately. Plus the waiter asked us three times if we wanted it. It felt like all they wanted was to cash as much as possible. That is when I asked why it wasn't complementary anymore. They simply said it had changed. The naan changed too. They used to be thick and the one I had was crispy, so crispy I wasn't able to eat it the indian way as it would break into pieces. The portion of rice is so small you have to order another one to be fully satisfied... let's point out that the small portion of plain white rice is 4\u00a3! I cannot say the quality of their butter chicken is bad. It was delicious but again too small for the price of it. Indeed, in the past I used to pay around 25\u00a3 for a drink, rice, naan and the main dish but I paid around 30\u00a3 last time. Have the prices changed too? Anyway, I will unfortunately not come back to that place anymore as I believe the quality has gone down. What a pitty. I used to recommend this place to all my colleagues...

The lamb chops and Jhinga prawns were outstanding , the lamb was cooked to perfection and the chutney that accompanied the prawns was simply heaven.

Food cooked freshly to order, can see food being prepared in kitchen area. Attentive staff and beautiful setting. Ate here while staying overnight in Sheraton Hotel and didn\u2019t expect much, but honestly the best Indian food we have ever eaten. Loved that most staff were dressed in traditional costume. Absolutely clean restaurant. Toilets situated in main part of hotel but literally just outside restaurant. Had two separate, quite dinning areas for family or small group which looks intimate and luxurious. Highly recommend for couples, families and/or groups. Corporate group in at the same time as us but this did not effect our waiting time or service. Food tasted fresh and authentic rather than precooked or usual sauce dishes.

Really.", "comment": "My wife and I were staying overnight at Heathrow ready to pick up some friends coming in on an early flight. We fancied an indian meal and chose this restaurant, which sits inside the Heathrow Sheraton hotel. Words of praise almost fail me, it is so very good in all its aspects. I'm not a young man and I have eaten thousands of indian meals in hundreds of restaurants all over the UK, but I can't think of a better one than this. For a start its decor and spaciousness is impressive and welcoming. You don't feel on your own, but the tables of sufficiently apart such that you don't feel swamped by your neighbours. On the night we were there we were met by a stylish and competent lady in a full length multi-layered, black evening gown. She looked quite the ticket. She swept along as if on rails, head held high, as she escorted us our table. The menu is extensive and quite unusual. For a starter I chose puffed semolina cases that came filled with spiced and mixed chutneys, and they were delicious; looked good on the plate too. For the main course I chose a lamb curry (saag gosht) and when I took the first mouthful, my immediate thought was \"I don't think I have ever had a better lamb curry than this\"; you would have to taste it to understand. Also the portion is generous. In fact, I wanted chapatis to go with the curry, but they didn't have exactly that on the menu. So I talked to the waiter and chose a couple of different breads. But only one arrived and about 2/3 through I realised they had forgotten the 2nd and so called over the waiter. He went to the grill area and they seemed to drop everything else as they corrected the mistake. These things happen and I wasn't upset, but afterwards the restaurant manager came across to apologise and then followed that with a couple of free glasses of really excellent champagne. We were delighted with the whole experience and say that - if you are within range, do make a reservation and find out just how good a really good restaurant can be. It's not cheap of course, but worth it for a special treat.", "date_of_review": "12 October 2018"}

If you\u2019re in any doubt about choosing this company for your big special day, please read on. Though Madhu's came up more on the top level of our budget, the things that we kept coming back to was just how good the service was from the initial enquiry,to our meeting, to the amount of time Agha spent with us - all of that before we even booked with them, AND before even trying the food! Now the subject of food. Both we and our families were really impressed and grateful for the service we received when food tasting with the Madhu\u2019s team in the\u00a0Southall branch. They were very attentive, listened to our requirements and were very helpful in finding out details from the wonderful Chef\u2019s team. Though we had picked our choices for the menu, the team brought us so much more to choose from - which in other\u00a0food tasting we never had - which helped us make our final choices - this was no easy task as all the dishes were delicious! We walked away very happy customers and 2kg heavier :) :) Now for the actual wedding day itself. From the very beginning of the day, all the way throughout, the Madhu\u2019s team were absolutely fantastic!\u00a0 The lunch food was extremely tasty, as well the canapes, starters and mains - all served hot, meat was tender when needed to be and the turnaround of food frequent\u00a0- we, our guests and family were really happy and impressed. We actually forgot about the silver service our top table received and this really was a lovely touch - thanks again to the team they really looked after us.\u00a0 No doubt we'll be back to the restaurant soon and of course have been advertising them to anyone who asks - but i'll be honest, we don't need to do much as they\u00a0respected what we wanted from day 1 and during the whole event, Agha and the entire team's efforts spoke for itself during our special day.", "date_of_review": "17 August 2018"}

To start my wife had the Keyde ki Tikki (pan seared crab cake) while I had the Murg Tikka (spiced and marinated boneless chicken), both of which were mouthwatering good. However, it got better! We both went with the Masala fish (Tilapia fillet cooked in Madhu\u2019s unique masala sauce) with a shared portion of rice and Nan bread for the main course. All of it was excellent, the fish virtually melting in ones mouth, the sauce adding to the experience. A glass of white wine accompanied my wife\u2019s meal while I had a pint of Cobra IPA - yes, IPA and not their familiar lager - which was another real plus for me. The slight negative, albeit made up for by the superb food, was the service was a little on the slow side. One thing which may be of interest to readers is that on the night we dined, the majority of other diners were Indian which I think showed the food was as authentic as it could be.

The staff seemed to be walking around a lot, but without paying attention to the patrons. We needed a second round of drinks and starters, but to catch somebody's eye was a real task. Finally I had to get up and ask one of the waiters to stop by our table. Food was okay. There is another place called Anayu in the Raddison Blu a few paces down the road.

They reserved the section in front of the bar as requested for us.  On the day, we had limited time 5-8pm but things didn\u2019t seem rushed. Food was delicious. The only criticism would be that the portions served were small and service was slow. Starters didn\u2019t come all together but in splits and had to ask them again and again to refill the dishes.

I had the strawberry kiss, a nice way to start the evening and this bar is open from 4pm. Very good and friendly staff both at the sky bar and restaurant. The restaurant has a nice feel and has two private dinning rooms which is a bonus and an area to also cater for birthday parties. You get a view of the open kitchen which is always a nice feature and pleasant decor. A nice place to eat but the food is as you would expect and no real surprises, which is not necessarily a bad thing. You are also given complimentary mini popadoms and three sauces.  Booking Process: I could not book by calling the main branch and seems like you just have to pop in or maybe call the hotel.  Location: Located within the Sheraton Skyline hotel, London Heathrow, Hayes UB3 5BP, England. Tel: +44 20 8564 3380 Parking: Hotel has its own car park and if you spend over \u00a320.00 either the restaurant or hotel reception will validate your parking for 3 hour stay. You need not pay at the meter just remember to get your car reg validated before you leave the restaurant. Decor & Lighting: Not too bright or dull and heavy on the red but its done tastefully and a pleasant surprise.  Ambience & Acoustics: I did not take a DB value on the phone but the level of music is just right and you can have an easy and pleasant conversation without the need to raise your voice. We had the following Food:  Sheekh Kebab - A large portion of 4 with a subtle spice and served with a little salad and mint sauce.  Achri Gobi & Malai Broccoli - A large starter and served with a little salad. Had a good taste and remained crunchy but very subtle in taste so maybe a little bland for some.  Khasta Veg Samosa - A portion of two and really enjoyed this and served with a little salad Murg Makni and Rice and Garlic Naan (Main) - A nice dish with a big portion of rice and main portion big enough to share. Well cooked and consistent with other places i have eaten so you won\u2019t be disappointed.  Bill / Cost: \u00a355.00 for two of us without any alcohol Conclusion: Good Service and fresh food but nothing out of the ordinary but a safe bet for an Indian. The menu is not the largest but covers all the main options and enough selection for all. One really big negative point to bear in mind is that they don\u2019t do doggy bags so no take away and stating a silly excuse that its the hotel policy. Having eaten at nearly all hotel chains and many restaurants this is a disgrace and I would say that it should be mentioned when you are seated. I would suggest you order less then order more only after you finish what you ordered. I would still however be happy to go again if in the area as its a pleasant and relaxing environment.

Upon entry - it felt good - not the typical Indian restaurant ambience. Quite open, comfortable, neat, and doesn't have that constant smell of spices - afterall this is only a part time Indian restaurant. Ordered the murg tikka and murg makhni, plus some papadums. Tikka was the best I have had. Makhni came with a huge portion of rice. Also done to a very high standard.  If anything - I would have preferred the dishes a little more spicy. Service was outstanding. Didn't have to wait for a table. The waiters were attentive- food came quickly. Food recommendation also spot on. All in all - very nice dinner- very nice experience .

Short wait before being seated despite not being busy. Lovely setting, nice, fresh, open and inviting. Drinks order wrong, but quickly rectified by our bar server.

Caetano was our server, efficient, happy, helpful, quick and eager to help upon dropping a spoon I didn't actually need replacing. Shows good staff training in place however, service was streamlined and efficient. Would recommend the Murg Malai and Tikka, nice vegetarian options. Not too sure the Robata grill is adding anything to the experience? Personally would prefer a real Tandoor. Makes the difference for Indian cuisine I feel. Suggest Robata is a gimic well worth dropping. Also, suggest getting away from these awful slates to serve food on. Understand somebody somewhere thought it was trendy and edgy and different 10 years ago. Now it seems somewhat dated, detracting from the food on the platter. This isn't Shoreditch, so not sure why these are preferred. All in all, some great selections. Wouldn't suggest \u00a35 for some steamed rice was at any time reasonable. Mayfair prices if you ask me. Or maybe just T5 vicinity prices. Would definitely recommend a meal here, cocktails looked good albeit never tried. Always like a place that pulls a good pint of Cobra however, so easy to get wrong.

A reasonable wine list (nice Rioja at \u00a333). Total cost for 3 with drinks and service was \u00a390 which for food of this quality in London is a snip. Can't recommend highly enough.

I read the reviews on TA and they seemed ok so off I went. The restaurant seemed nice and was busy with hotel guests and people like us who are staying nearby. Our table of 3 was by a glass partition which was fine until you realised that one person would be sitting right opposite the table on the other side of the partition - basically staring at them. It was quite off putting as I would not want people staring at my table. The restaurant either needs to put something on the glass partition to obscure the view or rethink their seating arrangements. Where we were it was also dimly lit so that made reading the menu difficult. So onto the food. The food was ok nothing to shout about. The staff were ok. My biggest issue with this place is there is no takeaway policy. I just don't understand! Their portions are big yet they are happy to throw left over food away rather then let patrons take it home. Upon enquiry I was given 2 different reasons. One - it was hotel policy hence no takeaway; two - we have nothing to do with the hotel. Make your mind up which one is it? In this world where people are starving to death, to throw food away because of a silly policy - shame on you! There are much better Indian restaurants to go to.

In fact, we tend to pass on any Hotel Restaurant unless we are too tired to go out after a long day or arrive from a long flight and are simply famished. So we were greatly and pleasantly surprised on our last night in London where we stayed at the Sheraton Skyline near Heathrow. Their internal Restaurant was Mudhu's. The Indian food served here was excellent. I ordered the Nalli Gosht and my wife ordered the Masala Fish. Being Eastern fare, each dish was brought to be shared. Both dishes, including the accompanying sides, were superb and had a spice element rarely found in Hotel chain restaurants. The wine selection was also good and we enjoyed an very good Red Wine (can't remember the name now or the country, sorry). But the Wine List was good, again nothing like the norm in Hotel eateries. To top it off the service was excellent. All servers are very attentive and you don't need to wait for water or to have your wine poured. The next time we are in the UK we will seek out Mudhu's outside of the Airport. If you are staying at the Hotel near Heathrow (if it's not the Sheraton Skyline), find your way to Madhu's.

Ordering as a solo diner was a bit of a challenge because the food at Madhu's is clearly meant to be shared with a larger group. I ordered nalli gosht as my main, and on Denny's advice, the rabota prawns as a starter. My cocktail and both dishes arrived quickly, with excellent sequencing, and I enjoyed both of them very much. The lamb was so succulent that I even enjoyed eating the fat and connective tissue -- truly the mark of quality meat that has been well prepared! My cocktail blended perfectly with the flavors of the meal, and I found myself sampling the pulao rice by itself simply to enjoy its delicate aroma and texture. I'd happily return to Madhu's any time, although I hope to be with a much larger group next time in order to sample more of the amazing variety of foods, especially the innovative and delicious vegetable dishes!", "date_of_review": "16 May 2017"}

It really made me feel so guilty that all this good food was simply thrown away, it\u2019s fine that we can\u2019t take the food away but Madhu\u2019s should find a way how to tackle this problem as we ourselves were unsure of how much food we should order as there was more than 10 of us.

Vinod was very reassuring and his team seemed calm but in total command. The non alcoholic welcome drinks were varied and our 75 guests never had to ask to be served. The starters were excellent with 50% non veg. Main courses were beyond my expectation, Bhuna Chicken, Aloo Gobi and Dhall + another 4 dishes. Hot fresh roti and paratha. They served Kulfi in smaller portions so guests could also try the Rasmalai. The service was relaxed yet very efficient. My nephew has a nut allergy, the waiter brought him an individual safe desert without even asking. Their food and service is possibly some of the best we have experienced. Our guests were without exception impressed and some said they were certainly coming back for a special dinner. You have to be really awkward to find a single point of complaint.

The restaurant occupies a very large and rather bland room. Attempts have been made to break up the space with an alcove for private dining and spaces reserved for large groups. The much-trumpeted Robata Grill is barely visible behind a translucent screen at one end of the room. Diners seem to divide about equally between air travellers and family groups from the locality. The menu begins with a list of dishes cooked on the grill which appear to combine starters and mains but which it states will be served when ready, tapas style. Fortunately our (2) butterflied king prawns and 4 large pieces of Sheekh Kebab arrived together: both were excellent. For mains I opted for a very dark, rich Saag Gosht (a lamb and spinach dish) while my wife chose something more unusual, Punjabi Kadi (a vegetarian dish of dumplings in a strong yellow gram flour and yoghurt sauce). With a Peshawari Naan between us this was a substantial meal, too much for us to finish in fact. My only real reservation about our meal concerned the price: 2 cocktails, 2 starters, 2 mains, naan, raita and mint tea came in at \u00a385 once 10% service had been added. (Despite this service charge, space was left on the credit card slip for tips, a deplorable habit.)", "date_of_review": "5 January 2017"}

Towards the end there were no waiters around and a few of us were very thirsty and noticed that the waiters for getting waiter from near a sink in the corner. As there was no one to ask we decided to go to the sink and get some water from a bottle. If there was someone around we could've asked. As we were leaving we were asked to pay for two bottles of water!!! Can you believe the cheek!!!! The manager on Sunday 15th January was ignorant and had a smug on his face throughout the time were trying to resolve his water issue. Ended up paying \u00a37 for two water bottles!!

The starters were, in my opinion, amazing! The chicken and lamb kebabs from the grill were cooked to perfection - charred in the right way but still tender and flavourful. The paneer had the taste of grilled halloumi (that's a compliment!) and the papdi chaat was also very good.  The mains however, were average. They were on par with offerings from more local, more reasonably priced restaurants. The murg chicken had an overpowering taste of cardamon and the lamb on the bone only had one piece of lamb with the marrow in it. Desserts were very nice and I strongly recommend the kulfi which was presented very well. It was our number 1 choice out of the 3 desserts we tasted.  If I could complain it would be about the following 3 things: Parking in the hotel is busy, but mainly because they have chosen to block off 20 or so spaces with boards for whatever reason. They didn't allow us to take away the leftover mains - of which there were plenty! I've paid for it, so it's beyond me that they couldn't put it in a box. Late into our meal, a table of 4 people were let in despite being dressed in football shirts and one of the gentlemen had a vest on.

I called Madhus Heathrow to request a booking for 2 people on a Saturday evening, upon calling the receptionist said they had no tables available for our requested time, I then searched on Open Table for restaurants in the Heathrow area and strangely Madhus were showing availability on the exact time/date that we had called previously and asked for, so I then booked successfully online. We got to the restaurant on time and the receptionist said our table was not ready and would be 5 mins..........15 minutes later we are still standing by the door waiting to be seated, she said they were getting our table ready and I could see from where we were standing that the table was nearly ready, when another couple walk in and the 2nd receptionist gave our table to them. We were stunned; this in our opinion was really unprofessional. We then waited for them to set another table up this was in the middle of the dining room and not very comfortable but we had to settle for it as it was nearly gone past 9pm. 2 things in our opinion did not make sense, when you call them to book they say there is no availability when there clearly was on Open Table, and the lack of communication amongst the staff, had the first receptionist liaised with the 2nd one then she would have known we had a table booked and the first table ready should have been given to us.  Food is average; we ordered the chicken tikka which was barely warm so we could tell it had been just sitting around waiting to be served, the other dishes were ok. If you decide to dine here, note that the portion sizes are generous so only order what you can eat as they will not allow you to take away any left over\u2019s, which was for us a complete waste of food and money.  Service was below average. I read a previous diners review saying \u2018this is one of the best Indian restaurants in London. A fantastic five star dining experience\u2019.

The chicken tikka, lamb chops, sheekh kebabs and vegetables are excellent. The naans were fantastic all fresh and well balanced.  The mains though not grill focused were truly great. They were unique tasting to their original restaurant and they had a depth of flavour that met up to the quality of the grill / starter course. Very impressive indeed.  The service is good.

So I was keen to see how the food would be at the restaurant. From the moment, I walked in I loved the decor and the chairs it was beautiful and the starters we amazing too. They were unusual and tasty for an Indian menu but the mains were a little over average.  I wasn't too keen on the dal makani it wasn't extra amazing and when we asked for a doggy bag, we got the dal wrapped in aluminium foil with no tub, which was disappointing, as I ended up throwing it in the bin when I got home. It's definitely not hygienic to wrap food up in just the foil. When we asked for the unfinished food to be packed to avoid wastage, we were told that they don't offer this service, which is strange as what does actually happen to the food?  I would recommend that Madhu's should rethink their food wastage strategy and offer tubs for customers to take food home, if unfinished like us. I mean after all they are 5 star and do produce good quality food, so why do they let themselves down on customer service? ", "date_of_review": "13 December 2017"}

I don't know which?? We booked a table for 30 people for a 50th Anniversary on the recommendation by a previous patron, now I understand that he has never paid for a meal personally and its on his expense account! The whole group could not be seated on 1 table so we ended up on 2 tables side by side....NOT ideal. Bearing in mind part of the group 5 had flown in from the USA & India we wanted a \"wow\" factor for the venue, to be fair it was that, but what let it down was the food, service & price The food was mediocre at best nothing to shout about at all have been to \"Dhaba\" style restaurants literally down the road in Hounslow who serve better quality food at half the price. Little do the hotel guests or those in the surrounding hotels know that a simple bus ride away in Hounslow you have the choice of all the Indian restaurants you could have, if you are more adventurous Southall, the home of the curry in the UK is a 20/30 min bus journey away!!  Try KARACHI EXPRESS situated on Bath Road Hounslow West (10mins away) but my fave THE ROYAL ALBION on Hibernia Road, Hounslow (20mins) this is a pub/Indian restaurant VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  Initially we were told that the meat served at Madhu's was NOT halal and on arrival we were told that it WAS (the meat eaters in our group do not eat halal) so after the table fiasco this was another blow. The Saag Paneer was the most bland I have ever tasted as was the gobi & Dal makani, the only thing that tasted good was the chilli/garlic nan, The Salmon & Prawn starters were excellent and that was the only good food that they served us (but Pricey)!!!  The food price was shocking, you would have thought we were in Central London!! The end bill was nearly \u00a3900 we had 3 variety of starters & 5 choices for the main course ALL veggie. The \"raita\" portion was barely enough for 1 person, was \u00a34.50 even though we ordered 4-5 everyone took one spoonful. When we ordered more rice, nan & tandoori roti it arrived after all the main course dishes were finished. This was the fault of the management and I do not blame the single waiter that served us, he was busy dealing with other tables.......surely if you have a large group there should be at least 1 waiter/waitress ring fenced to deal with the group especially when you have to take drink orders for 30 people as soon as he had finished taking the orders, the first lot had already finished their drinks and need a refill. Rather than have gone on the recommendation I should have in hindsight gone with my wife and tried the food first before committing to the booking....a mistake that won't happen again. I wanted to give it a fair star rating as my parents enjoyed the evening and the bill was not as much as I had initially thought even though there were a few members of the group ordering beer & wine but you have to bear in mind we did not order the meat dishes which cost more!! The manager (without us asking) gave us a 10% discount probably because of the table/seating issue. I would NOT recommend Madhu's & would not dine here again!! PROS: Nice setting, Free parking CONS: Food, Price, Service, dealing with large groups!", "date_of_review": "26 March 2018"}

On first impressions the restaurant seemed very smart, quite spacious. We were seated immediately as the restaurant was very quiet that early in the evening.  We all ordered drinks & started to inspect the menu.  My Mum is vegetarian, & the choice really wasn\u2019t very good for vegetarian curries. However, with quite a lot of debate with the waiter who was incredibly difficult to fully understand at times we got her sorted. My Husband wanted a very spicy curry, something along the lines of the heat of a Vindaloo. We were told that wasn\u2019t possible but they would spice up a massala which certainly isn\u2019t a hot dish. After ordering a rather large group of ladies came in & amongst a near empty restaurant were seated directly behind us. After 5/10 minutes or so we asked if we could move table due to the noise & that we just wanted a quiet dinner. We were met with some hostility by our waiter, who questioned why we wished to move after we had just explained why. He then said he had to ask his Manager if we could move! Baring in mind only a few tables out of a fairly large restaurant were occupied. He came back & asked what was wrong with the table. At this point my Husband & i we\u2019re getting quite irritated by his attitude.  We said once again because of the noise please move us to a quieter table. At this point had he not moved us we would have settled the drinks bill & frankly gone elsewhere.  After being moved, the food arrived. My Husbands spiced up masala wasn\u2019t very spicy by either of our standards, but had decent amount of flavour. My Mum was quite disappointed to find her vegetarian makhani was a cheese curry.  I had the murgh makhani (butter chicken) it lacked any real flavour, had no sweetness. The chicken was good & tender, but the curry itself wasn\u2019t great. We ordered a plain boiled rice & a saffron rice. Which came white, absolutely no saffron was used in that rice, it had a few seeds in & one cardamon pod & some peas on top. Saffron makes rice yellowish in colour & adds a distinctive flavour. This tasted almost indifferent to the plain boiled rice. The naan bread was nice but a very small portion size.  Over all, the dinner was over priced, lacked anything special & earlier in the dinner the first waiter was quite honestly highly irritating & argumentative. Neither of which are qualities one wishes to encounter on their dinner out. Doubtful we would come back again, and we do stay in this area many times a year.", "date_of_review": "4 November 2018"}

I liked what was on the menu as there were some spins on well known thai dishes. One delight was the sauce that came with the crab starter, that special. the food was delicious all the way down to the broccoli dish, i could have had that on its own. Will be coming back for sure.

The food was disappointingly mediocre. Pani Puri was so rubbish, the chef should be ashamed of what he served. The puri was so scantily filled with just sprouts that it was not worth \u00a37. Lacked of potatoes or any flavour completely. The Alloo Tikki was 1 tiny Tikki cut into 2 halves and served in a plate of chana. Pathetic again for \u00a37. They don't deserve to have a location like the Sheraton Hotel. The waitress had a cold so she kept sniffling in our ears quite loudly. I watched her swipe her runny nose with her palm a few times whilst serving a few tables. Disgusting!!. She was not properly trained for silver service. She kept leaping across the table to reach for plates and cutlery instead of coming closer. The table offered to us, a family of 5 were two round tables joined together. It made it difficult to share food and make it enjoyable. When I complained, I was offered desert for free. This didn't really help because the kulfi was commercially bought and not made by the chef. It tasted powdery. All in all the restaurant was nothing special. A local takeaway compares better than this restaurant. The furniture is old and chairs looks tattered. The pictures on the website are when they were newly opened. It's definitely not like that in reality. Don't be taken in by the lovely pictures.

I particularly liked the big bulb- shaped lights .We ordered the mixed starters for two which were quite sublime and packed with fragrant flavours imbued with delicacy and freshness. The Prawn Pad Thai was in the same league with the Prawns being particularly juicy and succulent although on a personal level I would rather have had a less intense sauce because it does not allow the other flavours to come through.

Everything tasted very fresh and very tasty. The restaurant is very cosy and the staff are always at hand to greet you. We were served by Sally who was genuinely very friendly and polite. We think that the first impression one has when entering into any restaurant for the first time is usually the one that sticks in people's mind whether it's be good or bad.

Weird timings - 17.30 or 20.30. I had to choose the relatively late 20.30 slot. Not sure who eats at 17.30 but it means they can get in two sittings. That tells you all you need to know.  People well dressed. An event venue.  Food was goodish. I wouldn't say it was the best but a cut above the average curry house. (Not my local curry house though). We asked the waiter to recommend some dishes as the menu is large and we were hungry by 21.00. The meat and chicken curry were cooked in the same sauce so tasted similar (picked up by mother in law who is a good cook). Can't remember the names but something poncy. No-one checked up on us. Needed water/beer. Had to keep grabbing other waiters after waiting for ages as first was busy with other tables. Would have had deserts but getting late and couldn't be bothered with what was going to be a long wait. Hostess turned up at the end to get feedback. Would have been nice to see her at the start or even midway through the meal incase we needed anything. A very average experience. Did get a receipt after a number of phone calls to Madhus to prove we were customers. This needs forwarding to the carpark agent so they can hopefully cancel my charge.

We ordered 'The Awesome Thai Platter' which consisted of Thai Fish Cakes, Chicken Satay, Spring Rolls, Wrapped Prawns. The platter was fresh and in particular the Thai Fish Cakes were beautifully flavoured with kaffir lime leaves. The Spicy Green Papaya salad brought a tangy sourness to the meal to compliment the richness of the Thai Red Curry and Coconut Rice. We followed the main dishes with a Panna Cotta for dessert which was a great refreshing end to a lovely meal. Shannon made it very special for us, his service and delivery was excellent.

I like this restaurant so much that I stay exclusively at the Sheraton Skyline or the Marriott next door now so I can have dinner here before flying out of Heathrow the next day. This time I had the Curry and Tandoori Thali which is a great meal for one as you get to try a little of everything. It costs \u00a3 30 (\u00a3 34.75 including taxes and 12.5% gratuity). For how good the meal was, I think this is a great deal! It has a Robata lamb chop, Murg Makhani (butter chicken in a tomato cream sauce), sag gosht (lamb in spinach curry), prawn moilee (two jumbo prawns in coconut curry), dal makhani, garlic naan, salad, and peas pulao. If you think the portions look small, be rest assured that they are quite adequate and the meal was sumptuous. In the past, I had ordered several dishes and it was too much food. The Thali is just perfect! I would recommend booking ahead on OpenTable as soon as you book your flight - they can get busy at times (with events) and you will not find a table at the right time otherwise. This place is so good that I no longer need to go into London for my butter chicken! The service was pretty good with several people stopping by. I highly recommend this restaurant.

Clean, reasonably busy. Good TripAdvisor rating. Service was indifferent and that is being kind. Of the two front of house staff the man was borderline rude...almost like we were doing him a favour, (the woman was as one would hope, welcoming and engaging). Drinks served. Beer exceptionally cold so things looked on the up. Started off with a chicken satay (x2) for each of the kids...delicious. Green mango salad...no chilli kick at all, no flavour that suggested fresh punchy Thai flavours I had wanted; massively disappointed. Main course came. Kids wanted chicken noodles; got chicken with rice. I remember the guy took the order with no pad. Fine if you get it right, but risking too much and it was a simple order, and I sent it back only to have to face some incredulity that it was me (or the children that were wrong). As it happened we kept it because they were too hungry and didn\u2019t want to wait for the noodles. As for the dish...bland, no freshness or zing. That pretty much described my dish too. I ordered beef with chilli...no chilli, no robust flavours that had been anyway near a Thai flavour dictionary. Just couldn\u2019t be bothered to make any comment when asked in a cursory manner if the food was \u2018ok\u2019. It was ok...but only ok. I asked the kids if they would come back. A resounding \u2018no\u2019. One from me too. Thai101 on King Street kicks this place into touch; out of the stadium in fact. A good sauce from the supermarket beats it too.

Today, there was a small problem, and I'm only telling you about it because when you can really see good service is when something goes wrong. I ordered one of the hot and sour soups, Tom Kha Hed I think, which I've had before, and it was perfect, really good, hot, sour, satisfying, the whole bit, but this time it was really quite sweet, it was odd and just not right. I asked someone to test it, and they brought it back a short time later, I think they'd added lime, but I could still taste the sweetness, so they apologised, took it away, and assured us that it wouldn't be on the bill. Again, one thing was a little bit wrong, and they dealt with it really well, please don't let this stop you ordering what has always been a delicious soup, I'm sure it was just having a bad day!  Everything else we had, the Pad See Ew, the Green Curry, and the vegetable of the day - Pak Choi, was delicious as ever, really good, flavoursome, well cooked and really satisfying. They also often bring a pre-starter, a prawn toast for meat eaters, and for me, a beautifully neat summer roll type thing filled with fresh vegetables, which was really good, I definitely would have ordered more for a starter if I'd known what they were called!  TL;DR? Awesome Thai = appropriate name, go there, don't forget to book, even on a Monday.  And if you live locally and they look busy but you still want your Thai fix?

Believe me, the journey is always worth it. Where can I start? I would literally rate everything in here a 10/10. The only improvement would be the drinks list, other than that I actually cannot suggest any room for improvement. The restaurant etiquette is superb, the best customer service. They make you feel more than just a customer, but family.  Their food, I really don't have words to describe how amazing it is! So authentic and full of flavour. My boyfriend is a super picky person, and usually isn't willing to try new places, but even for him, this place is number 1. I am glad I came across this place on Valentine's day because I am in love with this place. The interior is classy, so you'd assume the food is expensive, but its very budget friendly!

The spring rolls were crunchy and with the right amount of filling, which was very tasty. We ordered the green Curry and a chilli and Basil stir fried chicken dish with steam riced.  The curry had a nice consistency - unlike the watery dishes you get in most Thai restaurants. The flavouring reminded me of food we have eaten in Thailand. Similarly the chicken was soft and succulent and just the right portion size. One of the lady serving us asked if i liked spicy food - on answering yes she had the chef ensure that there was added spicing in the dishes as well as side dishes of chillies. What a nice touch - shows they care about the customer experience.  The restaurant is a tad small and tightly packed but clean and nice. Staff very friendly and helpful and service quite prompt.

Food was tasty and service was good. The waiter mentioned we were late when we turned up, although the table was not laid so they were hardly waiting for us. We ordered quickly and sat down to a really good satay, deep fried prawn and veg spring rolls. Also tasty prawn crackers and crispy seaweed. All excellent, not greasy and I think the satay could be on the best ever list.  Mains was green thai curry, prawn with asparagus and pad king plus 2 Jasmin rice and a pad Thai. GC was top notch, spicy enough but not overpowering so you could still taste to lemon grass and ginger. The prawn and asparagus was tasty, well cooked prawns, well cooked asparagus in a lovely thai sauce. The pad king was also well cooked as was the rice. After having several below par pad thais recently this was back up there as a good pad thai, tasty, fresh and almost as good as when we were in Thailand.  The waiter nearly ruined it at the end by trying to clear away the dishes while one member of the party was still eating but I'll let him off as we had overrun. Overall I would recommend but be prepared if you are near the front there's lots of walk ins and lots of deliveries. We didn't order wine but the overall cost was <\u00a315 a head which is ridiculously cheap for such a good meal.

Nothing bad, but nothing great that stood out. The mains were a different story, I am not a usual fan of the standard pad thai - but these guys do a good one with meaty prawns. I also enjoyed the green curry, although I wish it was a little spicier like they are out in Thailand. I think I would have given this place a 3.5/5, but their Thai Tiramisu dish wouldn't allow me to do it. WHAT A DESERT! The coconut flavour and the lightness of the tiramisu - amazing.

However, the food is not. Five of us had the second sitting on Saturday night, which is a sign of how popular the palce is but also a limitation. First of all the food is delicious, with tender satay and I tried my litmus paper test of any Thai restaurant - the Green Curry. This had the requisite bite expected and was not a toned down western version. Not quite Bangkok hot, but close enough to be very tasty.Not cheap, the value is in thw quality. The drawback is the two sittings. We got there about 25 minutes early and there is nowhere to wait - so we wandered to the pub over the road. When we came back there was still someone in the seats allocated for us so they were discreetly hurried on. If you're in the first sitting you really have to watch the clock. Personally that's an off putter - or having to wait whilst people are ushered outand you're sitting awkwardly. The space even then is quite tight. So my judgement is that's it's good, but not top notch due to space and trying to cram too much in.", "date_of_review": "27 February 2017"}

But I do think Awesome Thai deserves my effort, as you can tell the owner/staff have put a lot of effort and take pride in running the business (all in the details and the ingredients) and keeping their customers happy with their food and services. We\u2019ve been there a few times as a family of four, and being Asians we do know what to expect in Asian food.  The owner/waiter always offered a friendly welcome, the place is always clean and tidy, he\u2019s always happy to explain the dishes and alter it to suit our needs i.e. no nut, more spicy and different sauce etc. Their lunch bento offer very good value with good portion and variety. I enjoyed their curries with good balance of spices, herbs & body; I also enjoy the wide selection of salad that is refreshing. My kids love the Pad Thai and the non-spicy lamb curry. I must say it\u2019s not the absolute best Thai food I\u2019ve ever had (as it\u2019d cost at least twice as much), but it is good quality food, value for money, lovely services, and enjoyable special treats and occasions.

At the same time, the service was really attentive and efficient, without ever seeming robotic and rehearsed. The menu complemented all these favourable impressions. I am fond of Thai food and know (I think) roughly what to expect. A mouth-watering green curry for instance, washed down with perfectly chilled Singha beer! My wife had an excellent and less spicy stir-fried chicken with cashew nuts. Also memorable was the Pad Thai Koong: noodles with prawns, egg, spring onion and beansprouts etc.  I pushed the boat out a bit, but the meal for two still seemed very good value.

I asked to book the most romantic table which was only available at 21:00. On arrival, our table and the atmosphere were rather underwhelming. Not really romantic at all. For starters, we ordered the soft-shelled crab which was deep-fried and covered with too much crispy batter which stifled any flavours and textures of the crab itself. However, the main courses were far better...very fresh and tasty and we could not fault them for anything. The restaurant is basic but the food is very good, the restaurant is clean and the staff are extremely polite and friendly.

Prices very reasonable. And, finally, the food ... delicious! Very tasty little veggie spring rolls followed by a veggie & bean curd sweet & sour which was also really good. The other half very much enjoyed the thai satay followed by a mild chicken curry. Not normally excited by dessert in Thai restaurants but mildly curious about the \"Thai Tiramisu\" on the menu - wow! Had a smidgen of coconut in the taste & the base was sort of biscuit rather than the traditional sponge but all of this added to the enjoyment. So, all in all, a really good meal & can't wait to go back!", "date_of_review": "31 May 2016"}

I'll certainly be back for that massamun. We also had the prawn, mint and cucumber rolls which were fresh and delicious also. My friend had the red curry which she also loved.

It's quite small and friendly (seems like family-run), with a local clientele who clearly value it and we could see why. The food is delicious, freshly made and of a very high standard. We had the same in each case: spicy seafood soup followed by prawn green curry with steamed jasmine rice, and both were outstanding. They certainly didn't stint on the (very large and delicious) prawns, always a good sign. Prices were very reasonable, too, and (perhaps because it was our first visit) we were brought jasmine green tea after the main course, and then a sweet to share, which was really kind. And a small thing, but significant: when we were ordering, we said maybe two servings of rice; the waitress said maybe one, and we could ask for another later, if we needed it. We didn't, but what stuck in the mind was that she hadn't tried to get us to order more than we needed just to make the sale.

Complementary crackers on the table (such an easy but nice gesture so often overlooked by other rest), followed by satay chicken and spring rolls. Lovely. I've had the red duck curry twice now and my partner had the green chicken curry with coconut rice and sticky rice respectively and both times, we left nothing on our plates, it was so good. They bring little hot plates to the table that they put the china plates with the food on, so the food keeps piping hot - which I love! Service is fab - my partner didn't even have to ask for another beer when his glass was empty. And very reasonably priced at \u00a350 for two covering two starters, two mains and rice with beer and wine. Now my fave resto in West London and deservedly so. Can't wait to go back.

I can tell you as an experienced Thai food cook myself that the Thai food served in this restaurant is average by UK standards (which is low compared to Thailand).  We ordered a Thai green chicken curry which was terrible because it was made with a pre-purchased commercial paste to which they did what most UK (and some Thai) restaurants do which is to just add some coconut milk for a tin, add too much sugar and then plop some veg in. No sign of that much needed kaffir lime zest, or galangal and a measly amount of thai basil not leaving enough aniseed taste. The result was an over creamy, over sweet curry with no fresh/pestle ground grain and no aromatics. The Thai green chicken curry paste should have been made fresh for a restaurant that is rated so highly on TripAdvisor. No 44 out of almost 17,000 restaurants and probably the No.1 thai restaurant in London? I don't think so. We also ordered the fish wrapped in pandan leaf which was average and sea bass with 'special sauce' (made with tamarind, fish sauce and sugar), which was also average. Service was OK. The atmosphere was OK and the prices were also OK. All in all this Thai restaurant was average - certainly not awesome and not worth travelling a long way to visit.", "date_of_review": "28 February 2016"}

The basic problem is they take more orders than they can cook for, resulting in horrendous delays for takeaways and diners. The two couples either side of us were beside themselves with fury, having repeatedly asked for their meal, which they had to rush as they were going to the cinema. They both booked in good time but the delays were chronic. Even the takeaway clients were being asked to come back in 10 minutes or wait , resulting in a constant flow of people and the small restaurant being crowded. If this was not bad enough, the waiter kept a wine cooler between us and the next table, despite the fact neither of us were having any wine. Lastly, the lighting must be worst around, unless i have missed it. When our food arrived, the rice was overcooked and the duck laced with an overpowering sauce, which meant the meat was tasteless. Good news is that the green curry was ok and the beer cold. Conclusion,only go when you are not in a rush or you are immune to delays and mediocre food.

Our son and his family used to live in Barnes before they moved to Australia and recommended the Awesome.Before we retired to Cyprus we went to Thailand every year visiting just about every Region and fell in love with the food.Sadly Thai food in the UK did not taste the same - it was good but not wonderful.You could have a good experience in nice surroundings but it came at a price and simply did not match the true Thai experience. Obviously there is only one place to enjoy Thai food at its best - in the country itself - but the Awesome comes very very close to take you back to those idyllic times in Thailand. The staff there are simply wonderful,charming and helpful - the ambience is so so good - and the food - simply out of this world.We have never tasted Thai food like it anywhere else in the world - apart from Thailand itself - and we will never forget last night there for my wife's birthday.Also as I said earlier to sample Thai food \"above the average\" it comes at a price - the Awesome value for money is enequalled - starters.a main dish,rice,beautiful stir fried vegetables and a nice bottle of wine - \u00a353 !!! It would cost you that per head at places like the Blue Elephant and the food is not as good.If we do not do anything else on this short trip to the UK it has been worth the cost of 2 flights from Cyprus just to sample the Awesome Thai Restaurant.", "date_of_review": "19 December 2015"}

When we arrived we had to wait near the entrance almost hovering over other diners. There are tables either side of the restaurant then tables for 2 in a line over what might be a natural walkway. Everything is quite close. We were seated after a few minutes and our coats taken. Our table was right by the bar and telephone. The decor is eclectic and I am not sure that it works. Some wood panelling but not particularly Thai style, multicoloured flashing LED icicles hanging all around the restaurant and one side has large lightbulb shaped light fittings. The restaurant was busy and the service was a little slow. That said the staff were warm and friendly. There was 'elevator' music in the background, but what disturbed me the most was the constant trilling of the telephone. Not just a ring ring. The same annoying ring that my home phone has. It was constant. The restaurant is obviously popular for takeaway, and from our vantage point close to the counter there was a busy stream of people perching on the adjacent tables waiting. This was a little distracting. We both had the soup starter (I think mine was Tom Yum Hed). It was nice enough, but not particularly fragrant or anything to write home about. I had a veggie dish of Aubergine and the coconut rice. Again, nothing unpleasant about it but to me it was lacklustre for a Thai meal. I also had the banana fritters and ice cream for dessert. The fritters were nice enough but the ice cream was definitely from the cheaper end of the spectrum. However, I suppose at \u00a33.95 you get what you pay for. I love Thai food, think Thai Square is overrated but by comparison to this would give them 4/5, and particularly like Suk Suran in Wimbledon which offers light, delicate, flavourful food. So where I would give Suk Suran 5/5 for food, 4/5 for value (its not cheap) and 3-4/5 for service, by comparison I rate this as 3/5 for food, 4/5 for value and 5/5 for service. What I did observe here however, was many regulars warmly welcomed, and lots of smiles from the staff, so what it lacked in some areas it did make up for with friendliness. It is possible I am more fussy these days, as nights out are rare (due to babysitter costs), so I really want to enjoy the moment. I wouldn't rush back here, but plenty of the people of Barnes seem happy with it, so who am I to argue? All I would say is, if you love Thai and want to try something really exceptional, go to Suk Suran in Wimbledon. It is gourmet Thai dining.", "date_of_review": "24 January 2016"}

It would be unfair to suggest this is 'very good' as there is nothing particular that stands out and certainly nothing that has the 'wow' factor.

The food is fresh and probably slightly over priced for what it is but then being in Barnes you can expect a 20% uplift from the off. I would suggest sticking to the usual Thai staples such as a green or red curry and perhaps egg fried rice.

Having travelled to Thailand a couple of times, I found some of the dishes better tasting than any other places there and to date, I have not found a bad choice on their menu. A definite must if you find yourself close to west London - it is absolutely worth it!  Tip 1: Some of my favourite dishes are the Pad Thai, the Thai green curry with coconut rice, the Tom Ka Gai soup, the fresh rolls or the soft shell crab. Tip 2: Depending on where you staying in London, bus 209 and 485 can bring you in from Hammersmith station and bus 33 comes in from Richmond.

Everything from start to finish was absolutely incredible, the service was super friendly, professional and knowledgeable. We had one gluten free member of our party and one vegetarian, both were accommodated without any problems at all. The food is perfectly cooked and utterly delicious! I have a few photos but not of all the food as I was too eager to eat it! The bill came it at about \u00a3120 for five people for dinner which was a few starters to share and a main course each, which we all agreed was incredible value!

You're tucked away in a corner of an airport hotel, down a soul-less corridor, past the toilets. You\u2019re poorly signposted. You\u2019re on two peculiar levels, each with a very bare floor. All your furnishings are hard. All your acoustics are, therefore, harsh: hardly what I want if I am to dine finely. You have an elegant ma\u00eetresse d\u2019h\u00f4tel, who does her job well, but her heels clack loudly as she rushes thither and hither across the floors. Your furnishings are dark, some even black. One of the floors is dark. This is not uplifting for customers who want to eat and drink well. The table at which you seated me wobbled. The papad nibbles were nice and the beer was chilled and priced very reasonably. Well done. My main dish, your variant on nihari, was great in conception but there it remained. By the time it was developed and delivered it was bland and unattractive, insufficiently spiced and not unctuous enough. Nihari should be nihari, please. The naan, by contrast, was super. Super, too, was the service from Ms Poonam (thank you, Ms Poonam, for making a dull experience as pleasant as you possibly could). I protest at your imposing a service charge, but the law allows you to do that. So please will you consider a simple, customer-friendly statement about how you distribute the money you've collected?

They were extremely helpful, advising me on dishes to avoid and reassuring me that they would be ready to cater for our needs.  The food was great and everyone from toddler to retiree enjoyed it. I particularly enjoyed the vegetarian fresh rolls with avocado, cucumber, carrot, mint and coriander. But the best thing was the warm, friendly staff.

He stared at me very aggressively and then he gave me a glass of coke saying it was \u00a32 when I asked for a 80p can of coke. He carried on staring at me rudely. My father had been in the restaurant business over 20 years and I never approached a customer in this manner. I then walked out of the restaurant without ordering anything. That same waiter kept on staring at me as I was getting into my car to drive home as I had worked all day. I then blasted my horn at him and drove off. I was parked on Garfield road talking to my friend on the phone when suddenly 2 cars blocked me in. It was that waiter and the other staff who work there. My window was open and that waiter had a long metal spanner in his hands, I immediately closed my car window and dialled 999 and told them I was barricaded by 2 cars. The waiter than tried breaking into my car by pulling my door handle. The other staff then started taking my photo with there smart phone. One of the waiters started saying, \"You think we don't know anything\" in Bengali as I speak the same language as them and I am from the same ethnicity. I said, look sorry for blasting the horn. A lady was looking out the window through her house. The waiter started saying, take his photo call the police, that ladies gonna call the police. I said to the owner the other waiter was rude, he said the waiter was his uncle, he then threatened me saying we can call more people. They left and 10 minutes later police arrived, I explained to the police what happened, they said I can make a allegation that the waiter confronted me with a metal spanner but it will be his word against my word. The officer then said he'll go and talk to the staff in the restauraunt. Absolutely disgusting, 7 employees ganging up on someone with a metal spanner. He needs a spanner, cant fight with his fists even though he had all his friends with him. What a cowardly human being needs a spanner and bullying 1 person because he's scared. Anyone reading this review I have written this review with integrity and honesty if you are humane don't go to this restaurant go somewhere else please. In fact I know the restaurant owner in Vujon Indian restaurant 2 doors away, the owner has known me for 10 years and the staff know me, they treat me with manners and respect. They should get a zero rating.", "date_of_review": "17 June 2020"}

The staff are always friendly and welcoming and the food has always been ok. After my last visit as few months ago when they served up a dissapointing meal, I was in two minds whether to return this evening, 25th Oct, especially since 1 The Avenue is only a short drive. For convenience, a 2 mins walk from my home, I returned with 2 other diners. All three of us agreed the chicken was way too dry. The mushroom bargi was awfull, definately not fresh. Mushrooms are supposed to be juicy. They were chewy! How can you ef up mushrooms? Microwaved? Even the papdoms were'nt crispy. Very poor all round. I definately will not be returning again, ever!!

Followed by a fairly hot curry ! Chicken jalfrezi with my choice of lemon rice all very well presented and after asking for some natural yoghurt to ease the heat it was plenty for one person and one of the best curries in a while so 10/10 for \" Spice Station \" Chingford Essex.

Well my first visit to The Spice Station was the motivation. Friends took us there, they had been before, so there were four of us dining on a busy Saturday night. Poppadum\u2019s were crispy, always a good sign! The accompanying chutneys were delicious and there was an extra green one which is their own recipe and different, tasty and original. I like touches like that. The menu had quite a few dishes you don\u2019t see in your average Indian and that told me we were off on an adventure. I never order duck, only in Chinese, but was intrigued by their \u201cDuck Jalsha\u201d Lean duck pieces first crisped over charcoal then mixed with mango and ginger, then cooked on fairly strong spiced sauce with bay leaf and coriander, garnished with strew potatoes and coriander.  There was a long wait from the poppadum\u2019s till the mains turned up, but that tells me someone is cooking the food fresh and I am happy to wait. It was superb, as was the vegetable sides ordered and I would give 5 stars to the meal. As I say, if you want fast service and eat what everyone else is, go to Mc Donald\u2019s. I\u2019m happy to make a night of it. Clientele were quiet and atmosphere was friendly and calm. Service was attentive and caring and a drink on the house was a nice touch at the end with the hot towels and After Eights. All of us enjoyed our choice of food and the bill was very reasonable.

It is a contemporary Indian restaurant whose d\u00e9cor is really good and very appealing from the outside. We ordered beers on arrival and poppadoms. When they arrived with a tray of four dips we couldn't eat them fast enough, they were delicious. We then shared a Tandoori prawn starter which was good too. I then went for the Duck Peshwari which stated it was cooked in coconut and nuts, as per the naan. However, when it arrived it was stacked with red peppers - my pet hate - and lots of onions. We had this with plain rice, motor paneer and lau bhajee (pumpkin with spices) and my husband had the Special, which was balti lamb tikka, chicken tikka and tiger prawn. The prawn didn't really fit with the rest of the dish but he did seem to enjoy his meal, unlike myself who didn't like the main. The lau was nice but the motor paneer was very gooey with no proper lumps of paneer in it. We were given a complimentary drink after dinner which was a nice touch. I would probably try it again in there, but not have the same dish or if so, would ensure that it was what I ordered, although the bill did say it was duck peshwari so ... Was OK Foxyfox10", "date_of_review": "1 June 2016"}

Whilst I agree with the first proposition about Carlsberg, I certainly would entirely dispute the second. It was probably amongst the worst curries I have in endured in my life and I have been retired for over a year now. My wife and I had a takeaway early on the evening of Saturday 7 September 2013 and looked forward to enjoying our two (?) complimentary poppadoms, along with their four dips. Whilst the mango chutney and raita were comparatively pleasant, the same cannot be said about the other two, which were tasteless green and white coloured liquids. My wife commented that she thought the poppadoms were stale, I thought merely salty.  For her main course, my wife had a chicken Spice Special Pasand which she describes as bland and tasteless, although she did have sufficient chicken. As for myself, push the boat out I thought, so I opted for the Station Special Biryani, which is described as served with pilau rice and sliced tomatoes. Given its name and price naturally I presumed it would be served with bits of chicken, lamb and prawn, just as \u201cspecial\u201d biryanis are elsewhere. How wrong I was. It was served with an omelette on top, no tomatoes, practically no meats, and such scant amount as there was were just small bits of unidentifiable meat, no chunks, the rice was brownish in colour, fried and oily, whereas everywhere else pilau rice is white, boiled and not at all oily. It can\u2019t be that bad, I thought as I added some of the vegetable curry to the biryani, so I took a small first mouthful, which turned out to be most fortunate. The biryani was revolting and my whole meal ended up straight in the bin. What a waste of money. I then went out and treated myself to a kebab, at a fraction of the cost. For 40 years now I have enjoyed curries so I think I am sufficiently experienced when it comes to judging curries If I could give a minus star rating, then I would award -10", "date_of_review": "8 September 2013"}

They serve quite a few dishes that are unfamiliar in most Indian restaurants, although some of the familiar dishes are available. They recently changed the menu, but have still allowed my daughter to have her favourite (Malai Tikka starter - much milder than the normal Chicken Tikka), which is no longer on the menu. Some of the food is a bit hot for me, or very rich and creamy, but working through the dishes I think Achari Panner and Kadhai Murgh are both very good.

On a Sunday evening we decided to look for a Thai restaurant, one our \"local\" sister did not already know but not too far from our holiday home in Fulham. We found Awesome Thai on Trip Advisor and read the many many good reviews. And: our sister did really not know it! It was a really awesome experience. The meal was excellent. We all had different currys and everyone of us was totally happy with it. After we thought there would fit no scrap more into us, we got as a gift from the house a piece of Thai Tiramisu. What shall I say... we ate all of it, could not leave anything behind The team of the restaurant was sooo friendly and we had a lot of fun!

Possibly the most attentive service we've ever had in London: To begin with they opened the door for us, they then took our coats and made sure we had a table we were happy with, they brought us a complimentary starter (on the house) and made sure to tell us in detail about all the dishes. They checked up on us regularly to see if everything was ok and refilled our drinks. They also made us laugh a lot which is a rare occasion in London. When we were leaving they got our coats and opened the door for us again. We both left beaming, they were warm and engaging throughout.  The food was absolutely delicious and really good value for money. Definately the best Thai food we've had in London. The Duck Red Curry was a rare treat - particularly on a cold October evening. Very impressed and they deserve all the 5* reviews they get! We'll definitely be coming back soon :)", "date_of_review": "24 October 2019"}

I started the New Year determined to break out of my habits and try doing something different. So although we decided to go to one of our favourite places for lunch I did choose something different on the menu, which is also a new addition. The tagliatalle vongole with pistachio chilli and garlic. I think this is a southern Italian/Sicilian speciality. It may seem an odd combination but it is divinely moreish. I used to have the boar ragu which is also delicious but a craving for seafood usually means you need something it offers. The clams were plump and meaty and melt in the mouth and the combination of flavours perfect. My family loved their pasta with swordfish and seafood special, the corn fed chicken with mushrooms, huge thin real italian pizza and we started with perfect calamari and prawns - not greasy or chewy but crisp and perfectly cooked. Bread and olives are also complimentary unlike some places which sadly overcharge for this. House wine is fine. As ever Maurizio is the perfect host and you cannot get a warmer welcome.

Specials at \u00a321, \u00a36.50 for a small glass of Kir Royale. The food was average and the garden area could have done with a clean so overall distinctly underwhelming for us as a group.

The bruschetta was soggy. We had to order the fettuccine with speck and truffle oil (both tables next to us also ordered it and it looked great). I was unfortunately underwhelmed by it and the temp didnt help with it being like warm. My friend had the sea bass which was also just ok.  The highlight was the tiramisu which was delicious.

Tiramiso was lovely but the apple struddle was again soggy and heated in a microwave. Waiter even admitted his own mum serves it cripsy but it's the way they do it here. So one of my friends had soggy fish and pudding. Worst thing for me though was after the meal going to the men's toilets which were filthy and clearly not that days mess and that shocked me.

Alongside the starters, we received olives, bread and butter as an extra during our meal. At the end of our meal, after paying the bill, we received some amaretto and limoncello liqueur.

The booking was for 8.00pm, I have never been crammed in like sardines in a restaurant before, but this restaurant managed it well.  The waiting staff were a sweaty mess, not smelly or a problem, but they did not stop, they worked hard, for the whole evening. They should be given an award as they worked like trojans! The restaurant did not have a cooling system and the temperature was a bit unpleasant and sticky.  The service was slow, however after being served drinks and ordering the evening flowed ok.  There was a 50th birthday with a table of at least 8 patrons who seemed to get preferential treatment.  The food was authentic and tasted excellent, it was served quickly when ready, but not thrown down on the table as I expected after seeing how busy the two waiters were.

I am Italian and very critical of Italian restaurants in UK as they tempt to \"adapt\" to the British palates. La dolce vita instead remains true to Italian tradition, using fresh ingredients and serving abundant portions. Tipically, bread and olives are complimentary, a rarity nowadays in any restaurant.  Fried seafood starter was perfect, crisp and thoroughly cooked. The sardines had the great bitter taste you only experience in seaside Mediterranean areas. Pappardelle with wild boar ragu' (tomato sauce) and taglioline wild mushroom and speck were both exceptionally good, my wife who's a great chef admitted they were perfect. We also shared a margherita pizza to try the quality, dough is great and fresh. I personally prefer the mozzarella cut in chunks on the pizza, but that's just me. Strudel for dessert, again home made as mamma would do. Luca e Maurizio are friendly and efficient despite the busy night.

The evening was so nice- great ambience and a nice, noisy buzz from a pretty busy dining room. The table of Italians behind us were having a good time - always a good sign. The food was top quality Italian comfort food at its best. I liked the way the waiter let me have a small portion of a main for a starter - Aubergine Parmigiana - lovely. My wife loved her scallops and the wine flowed nicely. I worried about ordering the calves liver as at other places I have occasionally had to send it back for being over cooked - this was tender and pink as I asked for and as good as it gets with delicious mash and great cooking juices. Others had fresh pasta- beautiful, seafood pasta and stew, pizza , sea bream and salmon - all very well received. I mentioned to the waiter at the end how much I enjoyed the liver and he explained every detail of the cooking - brilliant.

I had the pappardelle with a wild boar and Chianti sauce which was amazing...followed by the dessert special of the day which was a lemon and poppy seed cheesecake with blueberries, which our neighbouring table then decided they were going to order later. This restaurant is perfect for a family night out as there is a kids menu too, with pizza you can customize, but would be equally good for a romantic night out as a couple or a birthday celebration.

As soon as we sat down in the lovely little garden, we were given bread and olives whilst we looked at the menu. The menu is excellent with several 'specials' as well. Every dish we had was delicious and the service was friendly and attentive We visited early evening on a Monday and most of the tables in the garden were occupied within less than an hour of us arriving, lovely atmosphere", "date_of_review": "6 July 2018"}

We chose La Dolce Vita because it had calfs liver on it main menue. It is many years since wehave come across a restaurant that serves this dish. It is an excellent indicator of a good restaurant. My wife and friend and i were attending the hampton court flower show and wanted a food experience to complete the day. It is very rare for halibut to be on the menue as so expensive,scarse or both. It was one of the specials which we all had. It was excellent and was accompanied by mash and carrots. I dont like mash but this was great.The serving of fish was liberal such that felt full up. I always order cheesecake in hope that it is good. Usualy I am disappointed but it was the best i have had. it was also accompanied by a sauce which compliment it. i was enjoying it so much that my wife and friend also ordered and they said best thay had. We came back second night for the calfs liver. It is rare to see it on the menu nowadays as expensive and difficlt to get tender peices. Usualy it is grisly and chewy even if purchased from well know supermarkets. This calf liver was tender, no grisltle on any of the 3 servings. There were 2 big pieces on each plate with excellent sauce/gravy. It was made from onions that come from Italy with gave the sauce a sweet taste. More great mash potatoe accompanied by spinach with garlic in. Whole meal excellent and remanisent of many years ago when there were small italian family owned restaurants. We use to go to Italy and eat out at expensive restaurants with our Italian friends. Thier calfs liver not up to La Dolce Vita. I had Tiramasu which was light and excellent. For my taste would have prefered more alchol but this preferenbce. My wife and friend could not manage any more. On top of such excellent food was the very reasonable price which included vegatables. Other restaurants we looked at charged between \u00a36 to \u00a38 more for veg. Trip advisorr price category overstates La Dolce Vita when compared to others we reveiewded. The waiter and chef were helpful and friendly. My friend had to take a taxi back to hotel as bad back- one of the waiters took her. Overall fantastac food and very reasonable prices with friendly service. It is mid range price with food equal to any fine dining restaurant.", "date_of_review": "7 July 2018"}

First impressions were very encouraging - a warm welcome from the very helpful Luca who provided excellent service throughout.

Firstly the welcome and service was great, was made to feel very welcome and was seated straight away. Unfortunately the other members of my table were 15 minutes late but I was never made to feel this was a problem. I was brought bread, butter and olives within the first 5 minutes and while I waited I ordered some drinks for the table. The waiter recommended a beautiful red wine as I wanted a smooth and medium red and it definitely hit the spot, it was very easy to drink and my mother in law and I drank the whole bottle with ease!  When the other guests had arrived we weren't rushed to place our order and this was a nice touch, it was very relaxed and we were able to have a little catch up before placing our order. We chose starters and mains and even asked to make a couple of substitutions which were happily met with a smile.  The food was well presented, great quality, and tasted like authentic Italian cuisine. The portions were a decent size too. My MIL's lamb was cooked to perfection as was my husband's salmon and we were all very happy with our choices. There was a little mix up with our orders but the staff were very apologetic and later gave us free ice cream and discount which was a lovely gesture. By the time dessert came around I opted to stay clear as I was bursting by this point but my husband and MIL chose gelato ice creams and sorbet which they both loved. I tried some of the pistachio gelato and it was delicious with nice chunks of pistachio nuts mixed through... yum.  As it was my MIL's birthday the restaurant brought the ice cream out with a candle and the whole restaurant sang happy birthday which was lovely. The restaurant is small but cosy with a nice community feel.  The only thing I would suggest to the restaurant is to make sure the jugs of water placed on the table are fresh and placed once everyone is seated and to make sure the jugs are shiny and clean as hard water can often leave a limescale look on the glass when not dried properly and unfortunately this was the case with our jug.  This however would not prevent me from revisiting and I would definitely recommend La Dolce Vita for anyone wanting authentic Italian cuisine and service with a smile.", "date_of_review": "24 February 2018"}

We did not have time to explore the menu in depth . We agreed to share a double sea food starter and went for pizza. The delicious, lightly battered squid prawns and whitebait was hot on the plate but disappeared quickly. Complementary olives had come with drinks ( of necessity I had to ask for alcohol free beer - I wish I could remember the name of the \"bavarian\" brew- I will have to call ). As new customers , the size of our pizzas was almost daunting. The thin crust was crispy . Topped out with excellence.

I had the fish stew which was lacking in depth of flavour and of course I too had the same problem with the mussels. The prawns were cooked perfectly the squid was a bit chewy and the stew was only lukewarm. The serving plates were cold which didn\u2019t help.

Amazing! On top of that, one of us spilt a whole glass of Malbec, then the waiter brought over another glass, again on the house - even though that was a mistake on our behalf.

The steak was excellent and I supposed as I should have expected. My wife had the burger which she thoroughly enjoyed, it was beautifully cooked with flavour and not dry as is the case with many burgers.

We ordered starters and mains and for the first course shared olives, chorizo with Malbec, shrimp, fried squid and my vegetarian partner had an aubergine escalope. The food was nice, with the chorizo in Malbec my particular favourite. Plates were cleared away and we sat back to wait for our mains. And waited, and waited. Our waitress never looked in our direction to explain the delay, but soon we were being reassured by someone I assume was the manager that our food \u201cwouldn\u2019t be long,\u201d then that it would be \u201c5 minutes,\u201d then that there was a \u201cslight problem in the kitchen\u201d then that he would sort us something out, \u201ddon\u2019t worry\u201d. Best guess, they had forgotten to put the order in and/or to start cooking it.  So, we sat down soon after 1.30 pm and our mains arrived at 3.00pm.  I had the 8oz fillet, two of us had 9oz sirloin steaks and one of us had the stone bass. We also had a variety of sauces and sides. My fillet was lovely, almost worth the uncomfortably long wait. I also tasted the stone bass which I would have been happy to have ordered.  The manager offered our desserts free to compensate for the long delay but even then my sister ordered a chocolate tart and a large piece of chocolate cake appeared. When queried, we were told they had run out of the tart. So, service wise,they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to let us know they had run out of what had been ordered and offer us a chance to choose differently. I had chocolate filled churros which I found disappointing. Crispy outside as you would expect, the inside felt undercooked even allowing for the chocolate it contained.

Most people only have one anniversary but we celebrate when we first met, our getting back together and moving in together as a couple to name but 3 that we celebrate. This visit was celebrating 2 years living together. We have eaten here before but tonight was our first evening visit and it was great to see a busy room even though it was a very cold night only a couple of weeks after Christmas.  Because we eat out frequently we were both taken aback by the upfront attitude of our server, Giovanni, who strongly advised us on menu choices. It is not our way to take that advice but, surprisingly, we did or at least partially.  OK, let's go to the food. My starter of Chorizo al Malbec was excellent. The spiral-cut rib-eye, recommended by our waiter was good and vindicated his choice. My partner had the fillet which was cooked as she asked and we decided later it would have benefited from a sauce, as those of you who know your meat realise that it is a nice cut that is invariably soft and tender but you do need to put the flavour I to that cut for best effect. All in all a very good meal as the Malbec we drank set off the meat very well.Finally, a special thank you to Giovanni for attentive service, good knowledge and his recommendations.", "date_of_review": "18 January 2019"}

For my last visit with my father on a Tuesday evening in January, the restaurant seemed surprisingly busy for the time of year. I guess that business in January is the sign of them doing things right. Despite this, service was friendly, attentive and quick (special thanks to Juan and Giada for looking after us). Food came out without delay and was absolutely delicious as always. For starters, we had beef empanadas, provoleta and Malbec chorizo. All three were done to perfection but those empanadas have a place in my soul. For mains, I got the 400g spiral cut rib-eye and my dad got the 200g rib-eye - both with fries. This is still consistently the best steak I've ever had. I don't drink but my dad ordered Juan's Malbec recommendation and loved it. I thought I'd over ordered maybe but still ate everything and had room for churros for dessert. It was too delicious not to take full advantage of the occasion. As for the bill, it isn't the cheapest place to eat but certainly is reasonable and the quality of what's put in front of you is second to none. Couldn't recommend this restaurant enough.

We had a couple of cocktails- one with Fernet branca and the other with elderflower cordial- yummy and we were lit  Then we ordered a starter comprising of aubergine, goats cheese and tomatoes. Of course we had a sirloin steak and spinach and fries. They offered the steaks in different sizes from 6oz - ladies size and up to 14oz Huge... It was so good better than I had expected.

A mistake, the cash I had saved for an evening out was wasted on a very disappointing experience. Our table was small and we were in a busy narrow thoroughfare. Our waitress was polite but did not recommend anything or have any conversation at all.  The empanadas were greasy and tasted of oil that needed changing. Chorizo sausage was tasty but overly greasy.  The steaks (sirloin med rare) were fatty and as the lighting was so dim it was difficult to avoid the fat which was horrible. The side of chunky chips was such a disappointment..tasting again of well used oil from a fryer and rather like inferior frozen chips . Salad tasted fresh but with an added dressing that would have been nicer on the side. I really wanted to like it but we left feeling very flat and \u00a3100 lighter - a meal that we won't remember fondly.  When we left was no goodbye from staff and we had to retrieve our own coats from the cloakroom as there was noone at the front desk.

I took my son\u2019s friend for a catch up, after ge has returned from Uni. He loved the atmosphere and thought a steak would be wonderful. Our waiter on arrival was Enzo, he was great, and plyed at taking offence when I said my favourite waiter wasn\u2019t on. The service was excellent as ever and Giovanni helped with the service And joked along as well. The starters were excellent as the calamari is my favourtite whereas my friend had the chorizo in malbec. The steak was cooked to perfection and everything was done with minimum of fuss but the attention and checking that everything was ok at was the right level. When we left my friend said he loved it. He liked the firebdly waiters and said he would be taking his girlfriend there as it was just so nice. The staff take this from a really good eating experience to a complete pleasure to visit.

The meal we had alone would have made the outing worthwhile. Service was excellent, the ambiance was great - but the steak was absolutely sublime. I am a steak lover and, growing up in South Africa, have had plenty worth raving about. I can safely say the steaks we had at Buenos Aires are the best I can remember having - ever. We opted to dispense with starters (although a tempting selection) and try the \"steak taster\" option, which comprises 4 steaks per pair sharing - one each of sirloin, rump, ribeye and fillet. Every one of them was melt in the mouth tender and oozing flavour. The charming and friendly Argentine waiters also treated us to a complimentary slice of pie. Not being a dessert person I'm not certain what it was, but the flavour was superb and the gesture was greatly appreciated. In short, I cannot recommend Buenos Aires enough if you are looking for \"write home about it\" steaks with great service and will make a beeline for it the next time I know there is one nearby.", "date_of_review": "6 November 2018"}

I finished work a little later than expected, which made me late dor my reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were a little flustered and the staff were very accommodating in making sure we got ourselves well settled before there was any pressure to place orders. We had quite a large birthday cake with us and our waiter Giovanni kindly got us a small table to display the cake on. Throughout the ordering process, Giovanni was helpful, patient & knowledgeable at all times. He was able to recommend dishes to us and knew the menu perfectly. Whilst waiting on us, he sweetly made sure that he always spoke to my 10 month old son, it meant alot to us that he wasn't left out at all. We were a party of 17, so the order was quite large, I was very surprised to see that all of our food arrived together. No one had to wait for food, the waiting staff were polite & courteous and the whole process was fantastic. All of the guests were perfectly satisfied with their food, the quality & standard of food was excellent and amazing value for money. The menu offers good of different price ranges which was great for a big party, it meant everyone could stick to their own budget and eat well. Our total bill was only \u00a3391, between 17 adults, such good value for money. When it was time to have birthday cake, Giovanni said he was happy to help with the process. Whilst we sang happy birthday, the waiters joined in and encouraged the other diners to also celebrate. As a mother celebrating a child's birthday, I was extremely happy that my daughter's birthday was made so nice. I will definitely be returning to the restaurant and would highly recommend others to also.  Thank-you so much for making my daughter's birthday such a happy one.", "date_of_review": "15 September 2018"}

I swear, at one point a baby next to us started crying, he came to the table and made the little one laugh in a matter of seconds. The rest of the team was also really nice, and all in all, the atmosphere is relaxed, while the energetic team makes sure everything ticks. We went on a Wednesday, and took the business meal. I'd say 20 quid is a very good value for money for a quality steak a starter and a desert plus a glass of wine to on top of it. The Steaks were high quality meat (and if you come to a steakhouse, this is what the place is measured by) but the starters (we went for the aubergine with mozzarella and the Calamari) and the deserts (ice cream and cream caramel) we enjoyable as well.

Although English would have been fine, it is always appreciated to speak your mother language when being away. Redouan led us to a table for a party of four. As we were taking a long time to decide and order, he didn't hesitate and quickly advised us on what to take. He explained in very simple words and in his perfect French what every meat was. For each meat, there is an advised baking. We followed his advice, and took the meats with the desired baking. Throughout the whole evening, Redouan was helpful and always asking if everything was okay. He wasn't invasive at all, he just made sure everyone had what he expected and enjoyed it so far. What made it a TOP experience for us, is to see that even in London a warm welcome in French is possible. The next day, we decided to go again and had the same amazing experience with Redouan.

Good menu Chose the 'steak' sampler, at \u00a323.95 EACH. A dish comprising four different steaks - fillet, sirloin, rump and rib-eye, with either salad or fries/thick-cut chips. It's a sharing dish so be sure you both want the meat cooked the same way. DELICIOUS. Really different. I typically go for fillet but here the rump was best by far. So full of flavour and succulent.

Looking around most of the others in the restaurant were eating pasta and I was wondering if the pasta was what the restaurant is renown for. My wife said hers was delicious. The white wine Sauvignon Blanc was smooth and reasonably priced. Finally my wife had the tiramisu for desert which she said was to die for.

My girlfriend was wished a happy birthday by the man on front desk, he then kindly offered to take some pictures of us overhearing us say we should get some pics.  We were shown to our table which was one of the best in the restaurant and within moments given two flutes of Rose Prosecco on the house. Such a kind thoughtful gesture from the restaurant!! They talked us through the menu and advised us where possible. Throughout the meal the service was excellent and Enzo was an absolute legend!! We were a little tipsy so I encouraged my girlfriend to climb up on the saddle which Enzo ran over in a panic to help and steady. Not sure the saddle is meant to be climbed on so we send our apologies to Enzo and the team haha.  Excellent value for money considering we had 4 juicy cuts of steak (ribeye, sirloin, rump and fillet) for \u00a356 in total with sides of chips/fries included and it\u2019s London! The steak is grass fed, incredibly tender, flavoursome and cooked to perfection. We ordered all four cuts medium rare.  Alhambra beer on tap is crisp, refreshing and so easy to drink. Thumbs up!  The churros were simply delightful.    The decor combines a sense of warmth, comfort and casual vibes with enough elegance to host a special occasion.  NEGATIVES: there were none!! but if I\u2019m really picky the double espresso was average in flavour and taste. Slightly over-tamped and harsh bitterness over-pronounced.  OVERALL: I\u2019d certainly return if I\u2019m ever in Chiswick again. Just found out there\u2019s one in Horsham which is nearer me so I\u2019ll be trying that much sooner. EXCELLENT MEAL.

We were in London for 2 nights for Wimbledon and chose this restaurant due to recent reviews online - and were so glad we did :-) The staff are so attentive and it\u2019s made clear that the restaurant definitely thrive on delivering a great service. I have a dairy intolerance..and also vegetarian (we visited this steakhouse for my partner!), so it\u2019s usually a bit of a hassle to find food that caters for me, however the staff here (especially who we assumed was the manager), couldn\u2019t have been more helpful; explaining each dish, sharing the allergy chart with us etc and even modifying dishes so I didn\u2019t have to miss out - you don\u2019t get this level of service very often, so it was much appreciated! My partner is a fan of red wine and left it to the waiter to choose his favourite Malbec, which he thoroughly enjoyed - thank you!  We got the marinated olives and rustic bread selection to start (however the manager brought me out balsamic and olive oil too since I couldn\u2019t have the chimichurri butter), Broccoli courgette and Cannellini bean salad, 9oz ribeye and Malbec sauce, sweet potato fries and my partner had the dulce de leche Argentine cheesecake - looked amazing!! The food was delicious and although we didn\u2019t have space for cocktails, they did look nice at the bar.  Ambience of the restaurant was good - quiet at the beginning (more attentive service though, which was great!), however it did seem to get a touch livelier after 8pm. Thanks again to Beunos Aires for such a lovely start to our weekend in London. We really appreciated the time taken to deliver such a wonderful experience and would love to come back if we visit Chiswick again.  Stephen and Katie x ", "date_of_review": "14 July 2019"}

The steak and fries were honestly incredible, some of the best steak I think I\u2019ve ever had, super tender and full of flavour. We had a chimichurri sauce and a peppercorn sauce on the side. The portion size is perfect. Next we had a dessert each, my boyfriend had the chocolate fudge cake and I had the churros, they wrote \u2018happy bday\u2019 with chocolate sauce on his plate which was a nice touch.

However, this wasn\u2019t a patch. We were sat upstairs which is the darkest, gloomiest and awful place to be sat. No atmosphere at all and we couldn\u2019t even read the menus as it was so dark. I ordered the 11oz Sirloin which was so full of fat and chewy it was inedible. I should have complained but I did the typical English thing of saying nothing. My girlfriend had the chicken melanase which was actually quite nice. Still it won\u2019t be enough to bother going back again. I very rarely give bad reviews either so it must have been poor.

Firstly, the restaurant is beautiful. It\u2019s split over two levels, with exposed brick work, and the perfect mood lighting for dinner. It\u2019s the ideal date place! We went at 6pm and I was surprised to see that it was already busy. Now I know why it\u2019s so popular! The staff were so friendly and attentive, giving some great recommendations from the menu. We decided to have 3 starters between the two of us, opting for the chorizo, prawns, and provoleta, which were all delicious. And then for the main event - the steak! We were recommended the 400g rib-eye steak. and just WOW! It was cooked to absolute perfection and it was a really generous size. Any steak lover needs to go here! It\u2019s worth noting that there are plenty of other options if you didn\u2019t want steak, but I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend that you do! We finished the meal with 2 delicious desserts, topped off with an espresso martini. My boyfriend is a self-confessed espresso martini snob and he said it was a great one so that says a lot!

The waiting staff were attentive and kind, especially when one of us (!) spilled most of the peppercorn sauce on the table - they cleaned it up and replaced it without fuss and without us asking for a replacement.  For starters, we had calamari, olives, patatas bravas and provoleta Argentina (a typical Argentine starter) - all were tasty and arrived at the right moment.  For our main course, we each had a 9oz steak, rib-eye and sirloin, cooked medium rare - they were perfect!! The meat was so soft, moist and flavoursome. I have not experienced steak like it since we bought steak directly from a beef farmer and that was the best steak I have ever eaten. This runs a close second!  Of course we made space for dessert - we had to since we were celebrating a birthday! And it arrived complete with a candle. Between us we had a variety of cheesecakes and a chocolate fudge cake.

Anyway, the main reason for coming out to eat is the food. And this food is good. No getting away from it, it's quality nosh, well presented, accompanied by good wine. We ended up paying just under \u00a350 a head for starter, main course, pud and wine, which - these days - is acceptable for this level of quality. My sea bass was lovely; served on a big whoosh of mash. The starter of whitebait and prawns and calamari, lightly battered with tartare, was very good too. Other options include pizza and pasta. Pasta dishes are hearty, and cost between \u00a312 and \u00a314. So although it's not cheap, it's good value. Just don't imagine you'll get much elbow room, or space to push back your chair!

There is alot of potential in this place, but they do need to clean it up and sort out some of the issues.

Most of the food tasted pretty good and in the set menus you get 4 small starters, 4 small mains and 4 small dessert so you do get to try a wide variety of things.

Lamb Cutlets that just melted away and Salmon that was just a delight. I highly recommend the Papri Chaat it was an absolute sensation. Then our mains wow. just wow. We had a mix of meat masala dishes accompanied by vegetable and rice dishes. The service from all staff that attended our needs was exceptional.

The floor is of wood, the ceiling is remarkably high (there's a small upstairs seating area, too), and the wall facing you as you enter is decorated with an extraordinary number of wine bottles. So that's all good. But the food is even better. As you might expect in an Argentinian restaurant, the steaks are special. The best (and of course, most expensive) is fillet steak (identified on the menu also by the Spanish name 'lomo'.) No complaints either about the starters, the wine or the sweets. I once had a lemon meringue pie there, and have never tasted better. It's not cheap, but it's excellent value. I doubt that you could eat better anywhere. Give it a try.

The service was impeccable and Juan (front of house/manager) is an asset to the restaurant. What a guy!!! He even remembered us from our last visit a year ago.  We live in Sussex but as we visit London to see friends we often stay in Chiswick and this is officially our favourite restaurant in Chiswick.  The 12oz ribeye steak was succulent, cooked to perfection and all the sides and trimmings were extraordinary. Big fan of the blue cheese salad albeit strong flavours to the tastebuds.  Alhambra is quality draft beer and I only know one other place that serves it and it\u2019s near me in Sussex in a tapas restaurant. It\u2019s crisp, refreshing and a subtle sweetness.  Their risk management of COVID is well thought out and all tables well spaced out with minimal risk if you\u2019re worried about a virus with a <0.3% fatality rate. Plenty of hand sanitizer everywhere and the toilets were super clean: saw staff going in for extra checks and cleaning.  Will 1000% be returning for another meal here.

Fresh, full of flavour and authentic. If you are visiting for the first time the tawa is recommended to try an array of dishes and figure out your favourite should you visit again.  The Chapli kebab and karahi\u2019s were my favourite dishes, not to say anything was wrong with the other dishes. I\u2019m a meat lover and loved every bite of these two dishes. I like spinach and that along with the daal these dishes too were full of flavour. It\u2019s very rare to find freshly made Pakistani food in UK, made from scratch, I could actually taste the freshness of each dish and that blew me away. Kudos to restaurant for providing this standard of food! I would definitely visit again.  The owner of restaurant took time to speak to us, he was very hospitable and courteous, he spoke with a lot passion about his food. The food is made fresh as he explained in small portions through out the day, the meat and chicken is not from frozen but sourced from the neighbouring butchers as when it is needed.  HMC certified. No one can fault a restaurant that prides itself in providing the best food and service to its guests especially when it is reflected in the end product.

However the food is not good. I went with my wife and friends before a wembley concert, we are all fans of indian food and have eaten in a huge number of restaurants including in india. The food here was overcooked and most likely reheated. The mixed grill was dry overcooked and a bit burnt. The chicken was dry and also overcooked. Much of it was deep fried. The worst thing was the meat in the curries which was almost non existent consisting of bones mainly and i can assure you we all felt the same. I dont like posting bad reviews but people need to know . We use tripadviser a lot and this restaurants reviews led us to expect truly good food and its never been more wrong and we were very disapointed. How it can be best and no1 in the area is frakly bizarre. They only plus sides are friendly staff and its cheap.

I love all kinds of Indian food and made a point of choosing this restaurant because of the rating. I was very disappointed by the menu and the 'takeaway' style, when I was expecting a proper restaurant. Tables were basic cafe style, not laid with table cloths , cutlery or glasses. We were given cans of Coke and had to ask for a glass. This is ok in a takeaway, but not in a place where you are expecting restaurant standards. I noticed on the way out, a food hygiene rating of 3, I wish I had noticed on the way in , as again I wouldn't have thought such a low standard of hygiene would warrant a number 1 spot on trip advisor.

And to leave them such scathing reviews. I bet your plates were clean.  We come here regularly. Kids love it. I love it. People who know what our food should be like love it too. Stick to you chicken tikka masala and vindaloos. I m glad I won\u2019t be bumping into you.  We ve just had another awesome meal here. Always welcoming. Always hospitable. Always authentic.

A friend and I visited in late October \u2013 Halloween to be exact \u2013 to belatedly celebrate my birthday and the restaurant did not disappoint.  The steakhouse is on Turnham Green Terrace and appears deceptively small from the outside. Inside, it is a large restaurant spread over two floors. I\u2019d booked in advance and we were received by a surly gentleman on the front door who should smile more. Once inside, however, our waitress for the evening was Natalia who was very smiley, friendly and attentive throughout. I\u2019ve been learning Spanish for over three years so was hoping I might get to practise a bit but we didn\u2019t encounter any Spanish-speaking staff on this night. We were seated on the first floor, which overlooks the ground floor dining area. The restaurant is dimly lit with soft lighting placed sparingly throughout and would be a romantic spot to take a date.  To start, we ordered a bread basket to share and I ate the padr\u00f3n peppers, which, if I\u2019m honest, were a bit tasteless, despite being chargrilled and seasoned with salt. My main was more impressive though. I opted for the 11oz (310g) cuadril, which is a rump steak, and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. An attractive piece of steak arrived with deep grill marks and was served with chunky chips and a small side salad. Some of my friend\u2019s green beans also found their way on to my plate. Slicing my steak revealed a pink centre and caused a small amount of red juice to pool on the plate, a good sign the meat had been cooked to my specification. (Fun fact: the red juice is not blood but rather water mixed with a protein called myoglobin.) I eschewed the offer of sauce and asked simply for some Dijon mustard, which I find provides the perfect accompaniment to steak. The meat was tender, juicy and a real treat to eat. I washed my meal down with a cold bottle of San Miguel alcohol free beer, which was a nice change from the more commonly seen alco-free beers in bars and restaurants.  My friend and I were thoroughly stuffed after our main courses and although we were both tempted by the churros, neither of us had any room for dessert: very unusual for us and a clear signal our mains were very satisfying. When it came time to settle the bill, we each paid about \u00a337 for two courses and a drink, which puts prices in the mid-range.  I would have liked to practicar mi espa\u00f1ol with some Spanish-speaking staff but nevermind. Would I return? S\u00ed, se\u00f1or.", "date_of_review": "26 November 2020"}

We can't recommend it highly enough. We had the vegetarian tasting menu. Each course was creative, innovative, beautifully presented and so delicious using high quality seasonal ingredients. Each dish was a stand out in its own right and also introduced us to ingredients we had never heard of before.The combinations of flavours and textures were in perfect harmony. We are not vegans but we noted that dairy products were barely used at all so this menu could easily be converted to vegan preferences. Special mentions much be made of the salt baked celeriac, and the artichoke dishes. Another course was bathed in a thai broth which had a depth of flavour that only time and talent could produce, balanced with lime which gave a unique spicy finish. Desserts were works of art - again with texture and taste combinations (e.g. lemongrass pannacotta , fig jam, fig sorbet and honey crisp) that elevated them to dishes of perfection.  Most of the courses were presented by the Head Chef or one of his team and we really enjoyed learning about the ingredients and inspiration for each course. We also learned that some dishes are only served for a few weeks or even a fortnight only in line wth the freshness and avallability of their ingredients. So you really are getting a seasonal dish of the moment!  Service throughout was very friendly, attentive, unobtrusive and knowledgeable.  I was surprised by previous comments on this site about what is perceived to be a formal atmosphere in this venue with a formal ? off putting dress code. Don't be put off. The website states that the dress code is \"smart casual\". The Great Fosters venue is such a lovely building - I feel it warrants a smart appearance. We personally wouldn't wear jeans to this restaurant, and in the winter a jacket would look smart for men -but its not a requirement. Most men wore a smart -ish shirt and trousers on the night we were there. We've eaten in many other fine dining establishments and this was no different. We found the atmosphere and ambiance warm, relaxed and very comfortable and we liked the buzz as the room filled up.

We started with pre-lunch drinks in one of the garden rooms - delicious virgin cocktails were very refreshing on a very hot day. The Tudor room itself is small - max about 20 covers and there were only two other tables occupied when we were there for late afternoon lunch - however were sat far enough apart that conversation wasn\u2019t overheard and we weren\u2019t interrupting others. We started with a delicious amuse bouche of Parmesan crostini with sweet corn. This was followed by a lovely melon and Parma ham veloute palate cleanser - with lovely texture of juicy solid melon intermingling with the pur\u00e9ed melon. The set menu includes a choice of meat and fish starter and main. We had a pregnant lady in our party who didn\u2019t eat fish so her choices were somewhat limited. However even she was won over by the explosion of flavours in the meat dishes. We had quail to start and perfectly pink lamb for main. My friend who had the fish was mightily impressed with the Thai style monkfish. Desert was a choice of strawberry shortbread, a Black Forest mouse or cheese board. The cheese board was incredibly impressive including five different cheeses arranged as a flight in strength order. My dilemma over choosing the strawberry or chocolate dessert was vindicated by the gorgeous juxtaposition of cherry and chocolate flavours. We finished with tea and coffee and petit fours. Due to a very slight delay in us being seated our ore dinner drinks were in the house. The service was attentive but not obtrusive and all servers were knowledgable about the food. It was very special to have the chef come tableside to finish each dish. We ended our exquisite afternoon by taking our coffee on the terrace overlooking to beautiful formal gardens. A lovely afternoon and couldn\u2019t recommend highly enough. ", "date_of_review": "27 August 2019"}

The food highlight was chapal kebab. These were very very tasty. All in all a good experience.

We've had a couple of uninspiring Michelin meals in the last few months, but The Tudor Room has renewed my faith. The wait staff were exceeding efficient, friendly and unstuffy - I know it can be a tough and thankless job at times, but they all appeared to really enjoy working here (that goes for everyone we met at the hotel). We've been lucky enough to visit loads of 1, 2 and even 3 star Michelin restaurants and for me service doesn't really get much better than what we experienced here. The sommelier was great and really informative and enthusiastic about the wines he served. He even very nicely agreed to write down all the wines we had on the back of a menu so I could take it with me. And finally, the food was perfection itself. It was a kind of hybrid tasting menu where some of the smaller dishes were set, but unlike most Michelin tasting menu's, you still got a choice from three different options each for the 'starter', 'main', and 'dessert'. This was a nice touch and ensured we both got something we really liked, which on occasion doesn't happen with set tasting menus.  Every dish was full of flavour and perfectly cooked (and not overly salty, which we find so often). I'm guessing the chef was classically trained as the dishes weren't too wacky - they were basically tried and true flavour pairings, which is perfectly fine when everything is done to perfection like these dishes were. Well done chef! Sadly, I heard the chef was going to be leaving the restaurant soon. I'll have to keep track of where he goes next and I hope Great Fosters replaces him with somebody as good - a tall order I think.", "date_of_review": "27 March 2019"}

However, the room itself seemed overly crowded - whether more diners are now being accommodated or it just wasn't as full on our earlier visit I'm not sure. The result, though, was that everyone talked in such hushed tones to avoid being overheard by adjacent tables that the whole atmosphere seemed a little subdued for enjoying such delicious food.

The Tudor Room provided a warm and fairly intimate, in a good way, dining space. We were served a nice amuse bouche followed by a cold soup. With a choice of two items for each course (rather than three as shown on the website sample menu) we then had a monkfish starter followed by turbot for main course, then chocolate mousse for dessert. This sounds ordinary on paper but the dishes were imaginatively presented and very tasty. Portions, in particular the main course, are on the small side but there is some excellent bread and butter. You can have cheese and all the trimmings - looked very good - instead of the dessert or pay a substantial sum to have this as an extra course. Coffee and petit fours are extra. We received prompt attention at reception with our coats taken and being ushered without delay to the restaurant where service was all the things it should be - pleasant, attentive, helpful and timely.  All the savoury courses were flavoursome and not overly salted like so many \u201cchefs\u201d seem to do to \u201cbring out the flavour\u201d whilst giving customers heart and kidney failure, through increasing blood pressure, as well as an unwelcome thirst.

Sadly the experience was ruined within the first few minutes when we were bluntly told at reception that they have a strict formal dress code - which was mentioned neither in the website, over the phone when making our reservation, or in the reservation confirmation email. We were then left in the lobby of the Great Fosters waiting for the restaurant manager, feeling like naughty schoolchildren awaiting our punishment. He invited us in to dine with them anyway, we apologised for not having known beforehand, and I suggested it would be helpful to have this mentioned on the website to avoid others making the same mistake - only to be told rather condescendingly that \"well, we are a one Michelin star restaurant...\". I'm sorry, but we've been to several other one- and two-starred restaurants who have been more than happy to welcome us and other patrons in smart casual, which is how we were dressed that day. I don't think he meant any harm by it, but that careless comment absolutely spoiled the afternoon for us, leaving my wife petrified of committing another faux pas and unable to relax. We should have turned and left at that point, but carried through regardless, only to find that... The food was decent, but nothing spectacular - I did enjoy my dessert, but the starter and mains were good but forgettable. The initial experience put a massive damper on the whole afternoon. To be fair, our waiter and waitress were lovely and warm, everything you would expect from a fine dining establishment, and they were truly let down by that one unguarded comment and lack of upfront information. I have no problem if a restaurant wishes to enforce a dress code and am happy to conform - I can totally understand that it changes the atmosphere of a dining room, and often for the better. But if you wish to do so, I think it would only be courteous to advise your customers up front (in my case, there were three missed opportunities to do so), and not make them feel like idiots, especially in this day and age where a Michelin star can be awarded not just to white linen restaurants, but to hawker stalls in busy food courts and pubs where casual dress is the norm rather than the exception.

Last Thursday I decided to use the voucher and take my wife for a meal. I booked a table for that evening. I have been to Great Fosters many times for civic and other functions but not to the Tudor Room. This is a beautiful venue with stacks of history. We were greeted outside and shown to reception. We took a seat in the entrance hall until a waiter showed us into the lounge for a pre-dinner prosecco. One of the best we have tasted. The attention continued with canapes that were delicious. Our order was taken. There is a 6 course tasting menu with choices on the starter and main course and the dessert. We were shown to our table by the maitre dee. The restaurant is staffed mainly by eastern Europeans and they gave us superb, friendly and helpful service all evening. The semellier was helpful although we only wanted one glass of wine each. It was an excellent merlot. We cannot fault the food or the service. The room has only 20 or so covers so it is warm and intimate.  We would recommend this for a special occasion with the meal at \u00a365 per head plus discretionary service at 12.5% plus wines although not cheap good value for money.  Our voucher covered the meal cost and we were only presented with a bill for the drinks. Interestingly service charge is only added to the drinks bill which seems unfair so we were so impressed we added extra. We would certainly go there again with or without a voucher!

For instance this restaurant used to have a sommelier, who would choose the flight of wines dependant on one's taste in wine (full, flinty, fruity etc). One really felt engaged with and given to - helped by a sometimes generous glass of a wine he was particularly keen to share - as well as educated and entertained by his stories of visiting the various vineyards. Now there is no sommelier and only one set wine for each course of the flight and each glass is scant and parsimonious. Our server could tell us a sentence or two about some of the wines (as might anyone who could rote learn), but the richness of the experience has gone.  My partner generally has the cheese instead of dessert and although the choice and keeping of the cheese is good, the amount of accompaniments now feels niggardly and no one asked if he wanted more bread or crisp breads. On previous occasions more bread and butter has been freely offered. Also on other occasions we have come away with a little cardboard box of leftover petit fours, but this time, our tea came with just two tiny ones each on an amuse bouche tray,  Other staffing levels seem to have been cut back. For instance on arrival, no one greeted us. The receptionist was on the phone and it wasn't until I wondered aloud, if we should just proceed to the Tudor Room unaccompanied that a second receptionist literally popped up from behind the desk and asked us about our reservation. He then spent several minutes peering at a print out trying to locate my partner's name. (At another Michelin-starred restaurant that we frequent, we are greeted at the door and the greeter seems to be expecting us.) Housekeeping also appears to have suffered cuts, with no hand towels in The Ladies when I visited.  Strangely on booking we were asked it the meal was for a particular occasion and my partner said his birthday, but no one mentioned this at all during our visit. If the question is merely being asked for market research purposes, then it would be better to ask this after the event rather than raise expectations in clients that something might come of being asked it. The food was delicious, with special mention going to the most delicious turbot that either of us have tasted and also to a interesting cauliflower cheese amuse bouche, lifted by a slight chili back-note.  However we missed the feeling of being treated generously and greeted warmly that we have had on previous occasions when dining here and, as this is an important part of the experience to us, we may not return again.", "date_of_review": "30 June 2019"}

OK not cheap in total but if its a treat or you can do it, go for it. I also enjoyed the service which was fun.  There are 6 courses but none are huge so don't worry about over facing yourself particularly. Also good was a choice on courses 3 (main) & 5 (pud) which is unusual on a tasting menu. We chose different options and our wine varied with our choices. We found the restaurant on Trip advisor when looking for something nice after racing at Kempton.

The restaurant is nice and service is very good. The grounds of the hotel are nice although unfortunately we did not spot the path to the pigs and vegetable garden. Of the menu the turbot was not the most inspiring turbot ever, but it was nice enough. The bread could do with some improvement as it wasn't particularly Michelin-starred standard although it was also fine, just nothing to write home about. The pork dish could probably have done without the BBQ element as it wasn't particularly good at being BBQ pork, however the pork belly on the same plate was excellent. The soup was quite tasty but should have been hotter. The pigeon was very good. The scallop was a good size and nice. The amuse-bouche were nice. It was very good value for lunch and we felt that the restaurant compares well with other restaurants in the area.The menu for dinner looks to be similar so perhaps not such a good deal at almost twice the price.", "date_of_review": "7 October 2017"}

There were six of us and it was an excellent evening. The service was exceptional as was the food. We started with drinks outside on the terrace and then were taken to the Tudor Room. The food was excellent - including the vegetarian menu that was requested for one of us - the Heritage Carrot is awesome! Our vegetarian guest was delighted to be so well looked after and to have her likes/dislikes taken into account. Both our host waiter and the sommelier had great style and were entertaining as well as informative. Our son said it was the best meal he'd ever had. A great evening!  Two tips. 1. We should have allowed more time before the meal. The hotel gardens are beautiful and it would have been nice to have had more time to look around them. 2. We should have allowed more time for the meal itself. Reception had advised 2.5 hours. For a party of six this was far too little. We were still going strong after 3.5 hours and we had to forgo the coffee as our taxi had been waiting a long time. This is a tribute to the staff who never rushed us and had perfect timing for us. This quality of the food (and the cost) means that you do not want to rush it - especially if you are enjoying the flight of wine.

The service was very friendly, but at the same time the staff showed excellent knowledge. Food was excellent, well presented, innovative and with a real finesse in the balance of flavours. There were many closed eye moments, when you just want to savour the flavour and exclude the world. For the final course I chose from the fine selection of UK cheeses, my partner the strawberry dish which she thought delicious, but did not have quite the wow factor of the rest of the menu. My knowledge of wine is limited, but the suggested wines were excellent in themselves and where a perfect accompaniment to the food. To end -My thanks for the selection of sweetmeats presented by the restaurant to mark my partners birthday.

We have dined here on a number of similar occasions. The lunch menu at \u00a335 includes some tempting canapes to accompany pre lunch drinks, amuse bouche and 3 courses and is excellent value. The food looks beautiful and tastes very good indeed. Service is very attentive but discreet, with courses arriving at just the right pace and drinks topped up just when needed. The Tudor room is small, intimate and very relaxed. Coffee was served after the meal on the terrace where the waiter secured a table in advance for us. A nice surprise for our guests was a delicious plate of petit fours with the iced message 'Happy Anniversary'. far too many to eat so some were boxed for them to take home. A surprise to us as well as the staff had acted on information we made when booking so a very welcome extra. Only 2 small points. I would expect coffee refills to be offered, particularly as the quite large cups were barely half full on arrival, or even better, why not give pots of coffee for diners? And I still believe that service (12.5%) should be at the customers discretion to add and not to remove when it has been automatically added.  Be prepared for drinks and service to add significantly to your bill but then this is a fine dining restaurant. That said, this continues to be one of my two favourite restaurants, the other being L'Ortolan near Reading, and the lunch menu is exceptional value.

To be honest, i generally steer clear of 'big hotel' restaurants, and the pictures of the Tudor Room, with it's fairly 'austere' and (i guess) Tudor decor wouldn't inspire me, though it is what the name suggests. On that note I can imagine really that this would suit a posh winter dinner, being quite dark and 'tudorish' , and can imagine retiring to the lounge for drinks by a roaring fire etc...  However that said, the food is the winner, and is after all what you are paying for. A very very tiny few tweaks and I can imagine a second star would not be out of reach. In line with what others have said, the waiter was superb (discreet, but made a few choice jokes and i reckon judges what he can say by his audience!!) It made what could have been a fairly intimidating small number of covers and a small room seem that bit more accessible.  Value is excellent - given it is only the full tasting menu on offer - it's reassuringly expensive but also not silly money like others in the same class if that makes sense.  Some of the amuse-bouche were excellent - the coconut pineapple one being outstanding and i wish i could eat it everyday! Choices for starters and mains were great - 3 options each with well thought through choices to suit all , and wonderfully cooked and presented. I loved that for dessert you could choose a sweet or cheese, which is something we often end up paying additionally for a cheese course and it's really positive to see the cheeses were all British (and lovely!) . The cheese option was also wonderfully presented with a lovely selection of crackers and chutneys etc (the truffled honey wouldn't be to everyone's taste but lord it was good!!).  A good selection of wine to suit most budgets - lovely pre-dinner bubbles on the terrace and a great after dinner drink in the lounge (though very quiet and as i said above i can imagine this would be much more atmospheric in winter!) - and me going off menu for a rum old-fashioned (try it, it's the perfect after dinner drink!) was no problem at all.  Finally, something I've always thought would be good - with your bill comes a little 'takeaway' menu to remind you what you've eaten . I've often embarrassed myself asking for a copy of the menu at posh places (as i like my reminders on special occasions) and it's a really simple touch but was lovely! All in all, would heartily recommend and will definitely go back .", "date_of_review": "26 June 2017"}

Great Fosters is a magnificent building and with wonderful grounds. My wife and I have been there on previous occasions when attending weddings or corporate events, but we had never dined in the Tudor Room - so we were really looking forward to it. The tasting menu, along with the canapes, amuse bouche and palate cleanser all combine to take you on a memorable dining journey. The food, matched with the excellent wine flight, represents great value when you take into account all the preparation, time and skill that goes into creating such fine dining. The waiting staff and sommelier are very attentive and enjoy some banter. Having dined recently at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir (which has 2 Michelin stars), we both agreed that the menu and food served at the Tudor Room were better and, therefore, we believe worthy of a second Michelin star itself.

The wait staff and sommelier were extremely pleasant, professional, knowledgeable and helpful with our questions and selections. We enjoyed chatting with them and learning from their suggestions.

The 3 different parts of pork felt like a piece of heaven in the mouth! Even trough there are only British cheeses on the selection , with the help of our waiter it became to be the best choice to finish. And the service is something what need to be mentioned! We been welcomed by the manager who presented the menus and double checked the allergies, the sommelier helped us to chose the right wines, but the best part came when our waiter Istvan showed up at our table. He is something really special! Makes jokes when it is needed, gives professional descriptions of food when he serves them and just always has a right few words to tell you to make you feel welcomed and special in the mean time!

Great Fosters hadn't been on our radar so we had no preconceived notions about what to expect. But the WTN knew.... Before the food, the service. It was gratifying to be served by unobsequious staff with a sense of humour whose welcome was warm and genuine. They understood the food, described it without affectation and served it unobtrusively. And what food....! Every mouthful had flavours we had almost forgotten. Three delicious 'amuse bouches', a pea and olive oil 'entremet' that awakened ancient tastes. Milady had crab with almond and avocado, I ate perfectly cooked red mullet and scallop. Her pork loin, belly and cheek drew long 'mmmmms' and this from a near veggie. I had the beautiful beef. If you wanted it other than sumptuously rare order something else or dine elsewhere. Conversation ceased. I had asked for a glass of syrah but Juan, the chatty sommelier, talked me into a generous glass of a South African pinotage and he was right. The chocolate desert was orgasmic (sorry Vicar) and accompanied by a kick-you-in-the-privates passion fruit sorbet. And there's more.... With the coffees came confections of macarron, bitter chocolate, pistachio nougat some of which came home in a doggiebox. . A \u00a335 limited menu lunch at this standard is an absolute steal. The extras are pricey but so they should be. Please go there before somebody wakes up and raises the price to a level it deserves to be. My only micro-niggle is that the beautiful historic Tudor Room is a bit gloomy but if it was good enough for Chopper Henry it should be good enough for us.", "date_of_review": "24 May 2017"}

The venue itself is a beautiful period property (Tudor-esque) set in lovely grounds - spoiled somewhat only by the M25 being literally in the back garden :-S Pre dinner cocktails went down well followed by a superb meal. For me the Tudor Rooms had the right blend of wonderful food and excellent service. The food was called a tasting menu, but it was more like a hybrid of tasting and a la carte. Excellent flavours enjoyed by all at the table; a great wine list which was equally enjoyed by all :-) Perhaps the highlight for me was the unfussy, expert, efficient and warmly genuine service. top marks.

If someone said they had booked it, I would happily go back and eat there, but I wouldn't book it again myself. I didn't mind the room and the service was OK, and fairly typical of a restaurant in this space. However, the food wasn't food enough for a restaurant of this supposed stature.  Starter of pigeon - cooked sous vide. Main of beef - cooked sous vide. Chef, in case you didn't know, this fashion came and went. It's lazy cooking, and it makes the food bland, and texturally wrong. And although there was a sear to try and put some life back into the meat, both starter and main were woefully under seasoned. I could understand it if there were 100 covers in the restaurant, and he wanted an easy life, but with so few choices on the menu, and so few diners to serve, there is no excuse for sous vide cooking (or under seasoning come to that). Get with the program chef! I appreciate sous vide cooking is not in itself an error, and some people, strangely, may like it, so here's where I think it was wrong, not so much open to debate, and reaffirmed that the clearly ambitious chef hasn't yet got the knowledge to carry this off to those diners who have eaten at the great places in this, and other countries.  The pomme puree was actually almost liquid. Lord knows what they did to it, as it didn't just seem like an excess of butter, but this liquid potato was just plain nasty and should never have left the kitchen. The small (but adequately sized) starter and main course were then dwarfed by oversized desserts. Why? The balance was completely wrong.  The biggest worry of all was the cheese board. Whilst there was lots of it, there was an horrendous concoction called 'truffled honey'. On taking off the lid of the pot, an acrid stench of truffle pervaded the room. Everyone on the table could smell it, and I only took the lid off for a second. I love truffle, but it is highly aromatic, and is to be used sparingly and with care. Whoever put this together, clearly thinks more is more. It doesn't mean that at all. It ruins it. Again, I worry for the skill and knowledge of a chef who would, in any way, think this disgusting tincture was appropriate to put out. The waitress actually said \"Some people can't even have it on the table\", and laughed. Surely that should tell everyone there something?? All in all, not a bad meal, despite my criticisms, but this place has a star, so every element needs to be spot on, and it wasn't. It smacked all too much of a provincial chef in a provincial restaurant who knows a bit, and is having a go. A restaurant putting out that food in London wouldn't last five minutes.", "date_of_review": "28 March 2017"}

We booked a romantic dinner at the Tudor Room as a special treat for my birthday. As soon as we arrived we were greeted in the reception area by a member of staff that had our booking details. I had booked a table for 2 but they had made a mistake on the booking and listed it as for 4. This was resolved very quickly. We were offered a seat in the lounge while they reset our table. We were then escorted to the Tudor Room to a lovely table near the door and the room was amazing. Large fireplace and old tapestry on the wall. The staff were amazing. Very attentive but not intrusive. The sommelier was exceptionally good and took care of us, as did our waitress for the evening. I could not fault the staff in any way. They were amazing. The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. We ordered the pigeon to start followed by the venison for the main. There were many other courses in between and everything was an absolute delight to the taste buds. Portions were generous and we both left feeling full. Now I am sure from the above you are wondering why the 3 stars. Firstly we wanted to give 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option. The reason for the lower star rating than we would like to give to Great Fosters was for the ambience. Ambience is very important to us when eating out as it adds to the whole experience. Although the Tudor Room was very pleasing to the eye there was no background music and my husband commented that he was distracted as a result by conversations of other diners. I had really high expectations following such a lovely wedding at Great Fosters. I was excited to go back for the first time since such a significant event for my birthday but the ambience was ruined for me by what sounded like a raucous party in the Estate Grill next door. It was so loud as the party were having a sing along which lasted our whole meal and I was mortified when they started singing The Proclaimers, 500 miles. I hate this song and it sounded like we were seated next to a pub at kicking out time. Such a great great shame as the Tudor Room experience would have been outstanding without this and with a little background music. Very unfortunate this happened on my birthday weekend. This was such a shame as I did not have the romantic experience I hoped for, even though the food and staff were flawless. My feedback to Great Fosters would be to think about what bookings they have and advise diners in advance if loud parties are taking place. If I had known this in advance we would have booked at a different time.  On the plus side at the end of our courses my husband ordered coffee and we were offered the option the remain in the Tudor Room or retire to the lounge. We opted to retire to the lounge to get away from the noise from the party. This was lovely and in hind sight it would have been much better to have had our whole meal in this area given the party noise. We had a very pleasant surprise in the lounge too when a lovely plate of chocolates and macaroons was brought out with a happy birthday message for me. This was a lovely touch. In summary I am really sad to give this rating as the food, staff and little birthday touch were amazing but the ambience on the night we went was terrible as sadly we were in a lovely environment with amazing food but it sounded like we were sat next too a very lively pub at closing time.

There were two NYE options at Great Fosters - a black tie dinner-dance, or a quieter option in the Tudor Room with more courses. Being naturally ungainly with insatiable appetites, we went for the latter option, and I'm so glad we did. The waiting staff were discreet, polite, incredibly knowledgeable about the food and trained to absolute perfection - which goes for all the staff at Great Fosters, incidentally. A special mention must go to our sommelier, whose jaunty moustache was the perfect foil to his amazing, astute wine pairings for each course and thoughtful explanations for each pairing.  A selection of delightful little canap\u00e9s wetted our whistles perfectly alongside champagne. We started with an oyster each, with a topping of something tangy, green and frozen (sorry, I can't remember exactly what it was). This was the only low point of the dinner. We both love oysters and were keenly anticipating this first course. Unfortunately the oysters were served in their shells, which in turn were on a picturesque be of cool stones. The combination of this and their frozen topping meant that the oysters themselves were frozen and tasted more like an oyster sorbet with an unforgettably bizarre texture. My partner found this starter absolutely vile but I could still taste the oyster and was indifferent towards it. The subsequent courses instantly restored our faith in the Tudor Room - all were utterly fabulous. Highlights included the most perfectly cooked langoustines, an unforgettable chicken consomme and a beautifully cooked venison course. As I mentioned above, the wines were chosen with great panache and complemented the food perfectly. We finished with petit fours in the hotel's beautiful drawing room in front of an open fire. The perfect New Year's Eve culinary extravaganza (oyster notwithstanding). We will definitely return.", "date_of_review": "2 January 2017"}

And I don't doubt that for a bit. For those that area searching for a fantastic fine dining culinary experience, look no further than The Tudor Room! This fine dining (now Michelin starred) restaurant is located in Great Fosters Hotel, just outside Egham. My latest visit was in December 2016 and I am already looking to book for the next dining experience! The restaurant seats a small amount of diners and allows its guests an intimate experience in a beautifully decorated room. My husband and I opted for the flight of wine option \u2013 we were not disappointed. It was an absolute pleasure to be served excellently chosen pairing wines by the wonderful Steve the Sommelier (I believe he\u2019s the Head Director of wine at Great Fosters). His choices of grape and detailed explanations of the tasting notes to be observed whilst enjoying each course was brilliantly delivered and not too \u2018over the top\u2019.  The tasting dinner menu started with canap\u00e9s and was followed by an artichoke amuse bouche. We knew that the menu would be excellent even at this stage as the colours and form of presentation even on these first two tasting experiences were phenomenal. For the starter I opted for the scallops with broccoli with truffle and hazelnut. The tastes were amazing and the presentation also made the dish especially appealing. The following course of langoustine tea was beautifully fragrant. I opted for pork belly with piccalilli for the main course and ended the dining experience after a cucumber, line and pineapple palate cleanser with a selection of cheeses which came with the most delectable truffle honey. The service throughout was extremely attentive without being too intrusive. Perfect for our special romantic meal!  At the end of the sitting I was pleasantly full and could not have consumed anything else. However, the flavours and textures of the entire tasting menu was so excellent I thought it would be a complete injustice not to take advantage of the final optional course offered \u2013 I caved in and decided to have the petits fours and coffee. In order to properly relax we were invited to enjoy the coffee and petits fours in the sitting room on the large oh too comfortable sofa. What an amazing experience \u2013 totally unrivalled.  Though I would love to be selfish and keep the existence of the Tudor Room to myself, Head Chef Douglas Balish\u2019s tremendous work is too good for me to keep quiet. I\u2019m absolutely certain that a table at the Tudor Room will quickly become (if not already) the hottest reservation within a seriously significant mile radius!!", "date_of_review": "5 January 2017"}

One of our favourite was the Jerusalem artichoke with perfect balance of texture and flavours. The smoked eel & foie gras starter surprised us. First the crisp and fresh note of the frozen grape hits your senses, followed by the texture of the eel and smokiness slowly replacing the cool flavours. Finally, just at the end the richness and velvety foie gras takes its rightful place on that stunning dish.

However, the cherry on top is the recent Tudor Room dinning experience we've just had.  We normally eat in the Brassiere and have rented the Garden Room for a recent Birthday celebration and been quite happy with the food and drink. The Tudor Room was a very different kettle of fish! The Jerusalem artichoke teaser was a real surprise and not something I'd usually order. Followed closely by the Scallops which were melt in the mouth. The Venison was good, not quite hung long enough but still enjoyable. Bringing up the rear was the amazing cheese board which was a real treat with the choice of ten to tempt the pallet although quite full at the time. My wife ordered souffl\u00e9 which looked and tasted amazing as a stole a spoon just to be sure.  Special mention is reserved for Steve the Sommelier. Honest, knowledgable and knows his way around a wine list, put your trust in his hands and you won't be disappointed. All together a great night with attentive well trained servers, excellent food and a good wine to wash it all down with. Well worth the the star!", "date_of_review": "15 November 2016"}

Cocktails in front of a roaring fire, friendly, attentive and professional staff and a meal that was truly exceptional.  The attention to detail on every plate presented and the flavours achieved .... well, just made us smile .... simply delicious from beginning to end.  Such wonderful food by Head Chef Douglas Balish and team was complimented further by charming and efficient staff who were attentive but discreet. As always, it was good to see Sommelier Stephen Farrell again - his quick wit always brings a smile and the wine suggested was a perfect match.

Long story short, we were blown away by every aspect of this dining experience. The waiting staff were kind, knowledgable, and exceptionally helpful, explaining each dish as it arrived and answering our questions -- some of them naive, some of them technical and probing about ingredients and culinary techniques. The wine waiter was a delight to talk with, and guided us to a bottle that suited both us and the food to a tee. The art of being a good waiter is often underplayed. There is a very subtle relational balance to be struck. Attentive, but not overbearing. Knowledgable, but not overweening. Relaxed and friendly, but efficient. The Tudor rooms staff were all of these things, and made the experience all the better. The room itself is beautiful and we felt \"the hand of history on our shoulders\" as we sat and ate in a space that has provided dinner to countless generations of aristocracy. And since it's conversion to a hotel, has graced the likes of Douglas Fairbanks Junior, and a rowdy crowd of Golden age Hollywood A listers. (The room we slept in was once occupied by Charlie Chaplin). But we were there for the food. And what a delight that was. We are addicted to MasterChef, and so the style of cuisine is very familiar to us. Each of the dishes presented as a work of art. Each component on the plate with its own back story. Each element combining to express a gustatory experience for the nose and mouth. This is food where nutrition is not the driving creative force. The chef, Douglas Balish, is on record as saying that his driving aim is to make diner's in his restaurant happy. Thank you Douglas. You achieved your aim with these two happy revellers. It's a cliche to say that \"the food is the real star\" -- and a falsehood. Dining like this is about a celebration of life, people, creative skills, the gift of variety and the foods we have available, our own bodies for the sensations they deliver to us as we eat. This whole experience was turbo-charged by the setting and the staff. Thank you.", "date_of_review": "11 June 2016"}

We arrived a few minutes early and were shown into the Tudor Room having waited a minute or two in the reception area. The room is very historic and has ancient tapestries and mirrors adorning the walls. The waitress offered us water and the menu and then brought along the canapes, including a delicious beetroot mini-macaroon and two cheesy varieties. The beetroot \"jam\" was stunning. The wine waiter (Steven) offered us the wine list and we ordered a Rioja Crianza, however, Steven returned with a better Reserva which he was able to offer us at the same price and which was a perfect accompaniment to our meal. The choices for each course were limited (just 3 of each), but spot on, I was torn between them. My wife chose the Scallop for her starter and I the Pigeon. The Pigeon was really VERY good, perfectly cooked (pink) and a great flavour. I think this must rank as one of their best dishes. My wife chose the beef for her main and I went for the Turbot. My turbot was lovely, but my wife's beef (which I believe had been cooked sous vide?) was stunning and competed with the Pigeon for best dish of the night. On reflection, I wish I had ordered it, it tasted so good! The other option was Pork belly which I would also loved to have tried. The waitress served us bread and butters, including a flavoured one (did I hear her say Bovril? It tasted very bacon like to me!), and we enjoyed more bread with the main course. Several other amuse bouche were served between courses, including a Langoustine Tea (delicious delicate flavours of Thailand) and a pre-dessert which comprised tiny nibs of almost frozen apple, with a creamy topping and a crunchy cucumber layer topped by a granita, the ideal course for such a warm summer evening. My wife chose Strawberries and cream for sweet and I went for the selection of 5 cheeses. You get to pick from a list of perhaps 10 or 12, and I went for the stronger cheeses towards the bottom of the list including a couple of blue cheeses. These are served with some unusual flavoured and varying textured crackers and some other accompaniments, including a very pungent (use sparingly!) truffle honey, some candied pecans, an apple puree and a fig jam which went lovely with the cheddars. We didn't bother with tea or coffee and petit fours, but we enjoyed every minute of the meal and the service by the waitresses and Steven (the wine waiter) was exceptional! We shall certainly return and perhaps experience some of the other restaurants in Great Fosters?", "date_of_review": "9 June 2016"}

My lunch guest had the cheese - a choice of 5 from a fabulous selection served on slate with truffled honey and fig chutney.  I must also mention the tall gentleman who served our wines (Stephen?). His knowledge of the subject shone through and he recommended having wine by the glass to complement our chosen dishes. Next time we will make sure we are not driving and treat ourselves to the Flight of Wines available with each course!!  I almost forgot to mention the petit fours with coffee....they arrived in a lidded wooden box which was left on our table after being explained to us - the orange and almond cluster and the coconut macaroon were my personal favourites...if I was forced to choose.

Whilst there appears to be a great deal of clamour for this restaurant scooping Michelin Star accolades this year, it really has to be tasted to be believed! The first impression is one of stepping back in time when you enter this Tudor building, but once past the grand entrance there is a more modern cocktail bar, with an extensive gin selection to wet the appetite! Good friendly service from the young lady (Beth?) in the bar, led to a delicious selection of canap\u00e9s whilst we were offered the menus and an explanation of what was to come... We were then invited through to the restaurant by Jenny, the restaurant manager, to a very impressive and intimate dining room. The service was professional, yet friendly and not overbearing. Steve the Sommelier was unique in his approach to his wine flight recommendations. A touch of humour with a vast amount of knowledge was a breathe of fresh air and led to some interesting yet perfectly balanced combinations. The food was the star of the show! Douglas Balish, the head chef, impressed with every course we consumed. Everything from the amuse bouche to the petit fours was executed to perfection. I had the scallops to start, beef for main course and strawberry dessert, all delightful but special praise has to be reserved for the langoustine tea, wow! The flavours were sublime and this could be the \"signature dish\" of the Tudor Room, as there simply was nothing we could fault. The petit fours were fantastic and exceeded expectation. My friends thoroughly enjoyed their meals and were as impressed as I. I look forward to visiting again and dare say a Michelin Star is a very realistic achievement come September, when compared to other London Michelin restaurants we have visited in the past. Well done! criticism comes quickly, praise is harder to earn, we will be back!", "date_of_review": "12 May 2016"}

So much did we enjoy it we popped back the following day for a hot chocolate and a look around the grounds!  Set in a charming, and fascinating venue, we were immediately impressed by the way we were greeted. Professional, friendly and also down to earth, we found that all of the staff were a pleasure to speak to. In particular the host who had just started working in the last week went out his way to make us feel welcome, as did the sommelier. Often in such a fine venue there can be pomposity, or a feeling that the restaurant belittles the guests. Particularly those for whom a visit is a treat, and who don't have the luxury of bulging wallets! In this case the service was really friendly, informative and a credit to the venue.  The restaurant itself is very intimate. At first I was a little nervous that it may be too so, as we could certainly hear every word of the diners next to us. In the event this relaxed, and it was not an issue, but was one minor consideration. When eating I. Such decadent surroundings it is hard to really find fault however! The food was sublime, each course inventive and flavoursome, and just the right amount of food. From lovely canap\u00e9s at the start, bovril butter and warm home made bread, and a bizarre but flavoursome langoustine tea, there were some real surprises. The main course of seabass was a real triumph, and a perfectly sized portion.  This really was a great experience and delivered at the level it hoped. Apart from the slight worry on the intimacy I had two minor points; both of which were inconsequential, but for am impartial review I include. The first point was the orange juice served whilst we waited at the bar came from a carton. I would have expected a default freshly squeezed version at such a venue, and such a price. It was a minor quibble in the wider scheme of things, but one I feel the venue should consider. The second point was confusion over a \"free glass\" of champagne. The Sommelier was truly excellent, a real pleasure to talk to, and we had thought he offered us a free glass of champagne as it was brought over without us believing there to have been any prior dialogue. I am sure that this was either a misunderstanding on our behalf, or an error on the bill, and I didn't wish to raise it for causing a scene at the end of a wonderful evening. We were both s bit confused why it had been charged for however, and certainly wouldn't have accepted the champagne had we known it would cost. That said it tasted lovely and again didn't detract from a really lovely experience.  I hope to return soon and wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone.", "date_of_review": "8 November 2015"}

Arriving in the dark as we did on a dank November evening, the first impression of the beautifully floodlit building is that you are entering a very special place. And indeed you are as you proceed through the tiny door, head bent low, and emerge into a magnificent hall with blazing a fire. Looking slightly over-awed by the opulence of our surroundings, we were soon reassured by the approach of a charming gentlemen who ushered us to the bar for a pre-dinner drink. We were then taken to the Tudor Room itself which is charming and intimate: there are only 26 covers. I was slightly disappointed that the menu was different from that shown on the website, but we soon found enough items to enjoy. The cuisine is modern and trendy with what might at first seem to be strange combinations: sea bass combined with chicken. But of course the chef knows what he's doing and it was really delicious. The rest of the meal was equally good, and the service perfect.  All in all it was a thoroughly delightful evening, made more so by the charming staff who served us and also explained the history of the place. So intrigued were we that we returned next day to have a look around in the daylight and explore the extensive grounds. I certainly look forward to eating again at Great Foster and can whole-hardheartedly recommend it. Two slight negatives: my pre-dinner drink in the bar was not up to the standard I would expect from such a high class establishment. I had expected that fresh orange juice would have been de rigueur ,instead of which I got something that tasted as though it had come from a cardboard carton in the \"Tesco value\" range!  Similarly with the hot chocolate I had when I returned the next day: this was very nondescript, tasting as though it was made from a packet with a bit of hot water. I speak as I find, so I both praise and criticize where I feel it is appropriate to do so. These two negatives are only minor points, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment.

Knock off work on Thursday, book a great room, organise the kids, grab the wife and spend a few days to recoup, recharge, spend some time just being together. Sometimes in this situation the food doesn't matter. A bowl of great pasta, a bowl of soup with some fresh crusty bread is enough. Occasionally its nice to dress for dinner, watch your wife as she slips on that new dress and gets on her heels.  This is the perfect restaurant for the evening. The setting is elegant yet welcoming. There is a formality to the room but this is tempered by the friendly, down to earth, genuine staff.  The chef here is excellent and runs a very good kitchen. There is technique and skill in every dish. Presentation in intelligent and attractive. Everything is thought through and executed with fine precision. Great flavour and lovely consistency.  The sommelier here is a treasure. He is the main focus for me in this restaurant. He is both accessible and characterful, with a good breath of knowledge and style.  A half bottle of burgundy for her and wines by the glass for me, were perfectly judged and interesting.  A very fine restaurant, run by a very fine team, serving very fine food and drink.

The evening started by us remarking admiringly at the wood panelled reception area, which is acessed by a distinctive small wooden entrance door, but took a worrying turn shortly after when my partner slipped and fell in the bar area. However, the quick thinking of the staff averted a potential serious knee injury by providing an ice pack, a glass of champagne & a Cosmopolitan cocktail, which combined to ease the pain! The dining area is intimate (only 24 covers) but surprisingly unpretentious, especially when the near-Michelin star quality of the food is taken into account.

We started with cocktails on the terrace, aided by a beautiful summer evening, but the grounds are stunning and the non alcoholic cocktail menu (and execution) made my pregnant wife feel like she was not missing out. We were served canap\u00e9s and olives while we perused the menu. I'd mentioned it was her birthday when booking, but didn't expect that every staff member we came across would wish her happy birthday. A really nice touch. Dinner in the Tudor Room was fantastic. The plates of food were really elegant and extremely tasty. My Pork main was the highlight, but the little dishes in between courses, were great too. Finishing with a 'choose your own' style cheese board, was also good. My only criticism...the crackers with the cheese were a little uninspiring. The staff were excellent, all too often in 5 star hotels and restaurants of this quality, it can feel like the staff are a little too well mannered and polished...not human enough.

Although I have dined here a couple of times before within the Estate Grill (slightly more casual, although still with the same Great Fosters prestige), which I have always enjoyed, I decided to treat myself and my boyfriend to dinner in The Tudor Room, as it has recently reopened under a new chef. With only 24 covers, I was confident that the attention to detail and flavours were going to be impeccable, as this is what Great Fosters is renowned for, but the standards on show far surpassed any of my expectations. The menu is a four-course sample menu, which comes with a selection of starter, main and dessert accompanied by two additional \u2018sandwich\u2019 courses and canap\u00e9s to begin. We also chose to have the accompanying wine flight \u2013 why the hell not! We started with a deconstructed appetiser of \u2018tzatziki\u2019 \u2013 yogurt powder with cucumber/mint gel served perfectly \u2018half and half\u2019. You wouldn\u2019t think you could make something as simple as this so interesting, yet the two halves combined together with such a fresh flavour which really demonstrated the different and new \u2018future\u2019 direction the meal was heading in \u2013 simple yet refined. With this course we were affectionately informed by the sommelier that \u2018to be honest, nothing really pairs with yogurt\u2019 as we were poured a glass of champagne \u2013 no complaints here!  I opted for the Cornish crab to start \u2013 a beautiful, if not unusual combination of crab along with a light, vibrant sweetcorn broth, basil and broccoli. My boyfriend went for the fois gras which included flavours of smoked duck, coffee, hazelnut and orange \u2013 a challenging combination, but each flavour stood out yet blended together in perfect harmony. The second course, Langoustine tea, is knock out.  You could smell the aroma of the Asian style broth as you glanced around the room, everyone waiting in anticipation and excitement for theirs to be served. When it arrives, it\u2019s as pretty as a picture, a bright, soft, peach langoustine tail, perched elegantly amongst micro herbs and a beautiful purple flower on top. It really looks too good to eat. The Asian broth is then poured from glass teapot over the top for the flavours to infuse together \u2013 completely Alice in Wonderland - the flavour is subtle enough not to overpower the fish, but the back tone of lemongrass and ginger is present enough to provide that addictive, salty umami flavour you get with Asian cuisine. This needs to be the hotel\u2019s trademark dish. Next up I went for the Turbot with asparagus, macaroni and wild garlic. The fish was cooked to absolute perfection. I felt there could have been some more sauce present, and perhaps the macaroni might have been better substituted for a softer tortellini or filled pasta, but the dish was beautifully clean \u2013 what a fish course should be \u2013 let the produce speak for itself. This dish was surprisingly accompanied by a red wine, which you wouldn\u2019t expect to work, but I was super impressed and loved the surprise that this brought with it, particularly as you could hear other tables in the restaurant also discussing their delight and surprise with the sommelier. The boyfriend went for the aged fillet of beef with bone marrow, wild mushrooms and truffle for his main. A marriage of all the best things. Again, the aroma of the truffle filled the room upon arrival, and I must admit I was a little jealous as it brought true nostalgia of a visit to Tuscany last year for my mum\u2019s birthday. The beef was cooked beautifully bloody and the truffle rested elegantly on top of the marrow in the bone \u2013 truly stunning. Next up was the pre-dessert \u2013 another jaw dropper.  Really simple flavours of green apple and sesame, and nothing else. It reminded me of eating sesame snaps as a young child, and again the flavour was crisp and clean and a perfect palette cleanser before dessert. A few words of warning for you here however that this course is accompanied by a shot of Calvados; killer. Finally we went for dessert. Well, I say we, I was far too full at this point (and to be perfectly honest, probably still recovering from the Calvados), but the better half went for the strawberries with yogurt, mint, almond and orange blossom. Now, I don\u2019t do desserts, but I pretty much devoured most of his, which must mean it was pretty darn good. We then retreated to one of the lounges for a much-required espresso, where we were presented with probably the best \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 of petit fours I have ever seen. Each one was lovingly decorated, and the perfect finish to an incredible evening. I must also mention the service here, which was, impeccable, to the point where I could hear one table asking their waitress to attend their wedding! All in all, I would strongly recommend a visit to The Tudor Room as soon as you can, as it\u2019s likely to be fully booked once the Michelin inspectors have been.

The food and service at Great Fosters has not always been great - it has taken ten years for my wife and I to return after a memorable (for all the wrong reasons) evening at the hotel. It was therefore with some trepidation that we entered the hotel. We had been tempted back by the announcement of the new head chef, Douglas Balish, arriving and based on his predigree felt it was worth the risk. We had pre-dinner drinks in the cocktail bar, a bright, airy space with great views over the manicured gardens. As we were eating in The Tudor Room the first of the amuse bouches were served with our drinks - wonderful pastry packages filled with cheese and taramasalata on small blinis.  We were then shown into the Tudor Room. A relatively small room enlarged by an enormous mirror on the wall opposite the windows looking out onto the gardens. With its deep red walls, a large tapestry hanging on one and the decorated wooden beams overhead the right mix between medieval and contemporary has been hit. There are only twenty four covers each night that the restaurant is open. The tables are far enough part for privacy and the seats are comfortable. The tables are quite wide so there is a distance between yourself and your companion. There is a \u00a358 fixed priced menu and no a la carte. There is an option of a 'flight of wines' for an additional \u00a365 where the sommelier gives you a glass of a different wine for each course. We did not take that option. A word about the style of food that Douglas prepares for you. All the food that is served, including the amuse bouches, are light in flavour, beautifully presented and not excessive in size. A chef that serves a similar style of food would be Jason Atherton. While there is a fixed price menu there is a good choice of starters, mains and desserts. We were surprised when we were told that the pre-starter would be tzatzicki having only seen it on holiday always the same way as a cold cucumber dish in a white sauce. When the dish arrived with the finely cut green and the separate finely cut white which you mixed togther it was a very pleasant and refreshing surprise. My wife and I chose the crab for our starters and this was immaculately presented with the crab meat topped with crab jelly, a small piece of sweetcorn and a sweetcorn consomme. Wonderfully light and tasty. The next course was a langoustine tea which was a langoustine served with fresh flowers with the langoustine tea. This was light and with strong hints of asia. My wife had the turbot with pasta and I had the beef served with the most miniscule but wonderful range of mushrooms. Both were delightful. A mango and lime amuse bouche followed. For dessert my wife chose the cheese. You are offered to pick five cheeses from a range of seven. All of the cheeses are British and cover the range of styles. The cheese was served with truffle honey and pickle. The desserts are listed by their main ingredient - chocolate, strawberry, cheese, etc. I chose the strawberry which was served with mint, a wonderful sweet crisp with yoghurt underneath. I saw the chocolate dessert being served to another guest and that looked really good too. Tea and petit fours followed (an additional \u00a36.50) and we took ours by the wood fire in the main hall. It was a perfect end to a wonderful gourmet evening. The service throughout the evening was friendly and very efficient. All the staff knew what they were doing and knew the food well. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a very special evening and would suggest going before Douglas Balish gets his well deserved Michelin star and the not unreasonable price goes up.", "date_of_review": "25 May 2015"}

The wines Steve (our Sommelier) chose were absolutely superb and complimented the dishes perfectly.

This time we were showed to the bar, the table we were given wasn't very nice which was a bit of a shame, we were sat right in the middle of the room and felt a bit on show.  Our table for dinner wasn't until 7 so we ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter didn't offer me to taste the wine before hand, he just poured the glasses and took the bottle back behind the bar. Luckily we liked it! We also had to ask for nibbles as usually they are always served with drinks. This was brought once asked. Our wine wasn't topped up, we had to ask for more, and we were brought 2 glasses of Pinot! We had to inform the waiter that our actual wine was behind the bar. Just a little less attentive than we usually get here. Once 7 came we were showed to our table. The Tudor room itself is stunning, intimate but light, comfortable chairs with beautiful art on the wall and a lovely fireplace. Our waitress was lovely, funny and friendly and always helpful. The food I can't really fault... I had crab and my partner had fois gras, both amazing and really fresh. For main I had pork and my partner had beef, it was so succulent and tasty! The little courses in between were a great touch.  We had NZ Sauvignon with the meal and a glass of champagne which was just delightful.  Dessert was a chocolate hazelnut type mousse, was lovely but not amazing. The cheese was really varied, I didn't like one of them but it was nice to have a change and sample ones I haven't before. The only slight criticism was the crackers, they were plain and boring! The truffle honey was so powerful... You only need a tiny amount!  When the bill came they charged us for 2 bottles of wine, but this was quickly rectified!  Other than that we really enjoyed our evening here. The food really is special and the ambience and atmosphere is also. A real treat. ", "date_of_review": "8 June 2015"}

Similar story with sommelier - confident, to the point, charming persona (loved the mustache!). Good choice of red wines at all price points.  Food - I give an overall 4.5 stars only because the main (beef) was slightly too salty for my taste.

My pollock was also outstanding. But we all had the same dessert, a sort of deconstructed Peach Melba. Whilst it looked great, there was something in one of the accompaniments (which seemed to be like a strip of panna cotta) which left a weird and lingering aftertaste, wish I had asked what this was.

The chef's background as an artist ensured that presentation was faultless and we took a moment to admire each dish before tasting.

The Tudor Room is a hidden gem that deserves more notoriety not to mention the Michelin star that they are working towards. We had the 8 course tasting menu for \u00a375 a head.

What you get here is a full and indulgent dining experience. Head chef, Nik Chappell really is a genius. He has created all of these original dishes himself and although we really enjoyed the food the first time we visited, he has surpassed himself with the new September menu. Of particular note were the crab, foie gras and venison dishes (the later served with a chocolate sauce that really, really worked!) and both the pre-dessert (light, simple and clever) and dessert were amazing. The first time I went, I said the foie gras dish was one of the best I have ever tasted anywhere, this time I said the same of the venison.

The bread was 4 small hand baked loaves of different flavours with some butter and some seaweed butter accompaniment. The service was excellent.

The quality was excellent which was matched by the service, wine selection and pace. A wonderful treat and am already planning my return.", "date_of_review": "10 May 2014"}

Had the 3 course lunch, with two extra amuses-bouches, and everything was delightful. Service was excellent, and could only be faulted when we were asked in mid-conversation if we were enjoying the food. Not a problem, as the staff seemed so genuinely keen to know our thoughts, probably for feedback to the new chef, Nick Chappell.  Ambience is delightful, perhaps a little \"twee\"? Only two choices on each of the 3-course menu, but so difficult to choose! The three of us left very happy. I was just a bit disappointed with my dessert.......hot chocolate tart was cold, but it blended so well with the coconut sorbet...though seemed too creamy to be a sorbet!  My main course was bass with curried mussels and lentils.....really great! Some people may find this too spicy, but I certainly did not....just perfect! Will certainly go again, but with only 24 covers, booking is essential, hope to try the evening tasting menu soon. Could complain about the car park, but surely this is partially due to the recent floods, took ages to park, not the fault of Great Fosters. Also, reception at the main desk (when you could find it) was somewhat lacking in finesse, and we were kept waiting for a short while, but all forgotten once inside the beautiful Tudor Room.

Each visit has been excellent and it's extremely comforting to have somewhere you can rely on in this day and age. The ratings below are a consistent reflection of our repeated experiences. Service, atmosphere and the quality of food are all truly excellent. Other reviews will attest to our experiences, but there are a few additional comments which are relevant to the standards The Tudor Room strives to set / meet. i) The capacity if the dining room is limited to a maximum of 24 covers so service is always relaxed, well paced, discrete and attentive. There appears to be no attempt to 'turn tables over' so we have never felt pressured to rush our meal. ii) We enjoyed an eight course tasting menu produced by The Tudor Room's new chef, Nik Chappell - formerly Head Chef at the L'Ortolan. There were some new and interesting twists to a number of dishes that were definitely different to the previous meals we've had there. Looks positive for the future and it's good that Great Fosters are looking to keep things \"fresh\". iii) The most pleasing thing about our last visit was that we booked a table on Valentine's Day which is notorious for being 'exploited' by many restaurants to cram as many people as possible into the dining room and usually two sittings. Not true for The Tudor Room - there were only 14 covers for the evening and no second sittings. Granted one paid a premium price for the evening but it was worth the extra which included an eight course menu, a glass of champagne and a rose for the ladies with standards of service, atmosphere and attentiveness as high as ever. It's great to have a quality restaurant providing a reliable and excellent dining experience. We'll definitely be back!", "date_of_review": "17 February 2014"}

The rooms remains cosy and not crowded, we could talk to the adjacent table and did a couple of times but not so close as we were listening into their conversation. The highlight last time was the bread but this time the food. Very good pert ion control with some very inventive dished well presented and well cooked. The standouts were the rabbit and the beef for very different reasons. The rabbit and foie gras balloting, verjus, with raisin and pistachio was smooth, full of flavour, but subtle in the flavour and texture combinations available on the plate. The Sirlion, smoked shin of beef with onion, turnip and liquorice was the complete opposite, one wonders where the chefs come up with these combinations and how they get it so right. Beef and liquorice is not a combination that springs easily to the mind and having overcome that hurdle getting the right flavour of beef is critical. This is a plate that stands up and smacks you in the mouth, strong strong flavours that simple work. Not that this should be considered to be denigrating to the other dishes the cheese dish is an absolute gem, Truffled Tamworth, a delightful pan fired crumpet, finished with honey and quince, simple a delight. The Seared scallop, pine braised pig cheek with apple suffered only that it was between the rabbit and the beef, the cheek was cooked to perfection. And the wine flight you ask, brilliant, not stinting on the portions matching extremely well to the dishes and again with a few German discoveries including a Riesling that was truly astonishing. The service was excellent from the moment we walked or should I say dodged through the front door to the tea and coffee that saw us back out the door. Again go there now the first of the stars cannot be far away and then getting a table will become an issue.", "date_of_review": "29 March 2014"}

The food is very good not quite to the top just yet but I would suggest you go now because the Michelin stars cannot be too far away, some inventive dishes, we had the tasting menu but enough to show a talented chef working with really good ingredients and producing some very accomplished cooking indeed. The scallops with Pak Choi and Thai flavoured noodles were a revelation, a dish that could easily have gone wrong was sensational. a great change from the tendency to put pork or foie gras against the scallop, this was fresh and the Thai noodle excellently seasoned and spiced. The venison I was nervous about having had a sensational venison dish at Latymer recently, this was a very different take that worked really well as here the dish worked as a whole with the vegetable flavours balancing really well against the ham and venison and the wild rice finishing the meat really eel as did the bitter chocolate and jumper sauce adding a brilliant note, but this dish bought my only moan, the portion control was a little tight on the meat, but as it is a tasting menu understandable. The desert was excellent as were all the courses, presentation was excellent and seasoning spot on all the way. The star was the bread, three breads that I could have just sat and eaten all day, innovative and really well and freshly baked.

The entrance is astonishing with a huge fireplace and a lovely desk; in this occasion when we entered there was a beautiful bride and groom taking pictures, and I can't imagine a better place to take picture of your wedding. ..anyway lets get to the restaurant;  A gentleman escorted us to the Tudor Room, a cosy room with around 6 tables dressed very elegant.  The service staff took our coats to another room and we sat at our table, a very big table with one comfy chair on one side and a small sofa on the other where my partner sat and loved it. The service staff were very organised and professionals but still very friendly making us feel comfortable and cared. The manager came to take our drinks order and he advised a bottle of wine to go with our menu, which complimented it very well. We opted for the 8 courses tasting menu but if you count the canapes and petit four is 10 !!! The canapes arrived on a wooden board/tray with dry ice underneath making a great effect, there was a selection of canapes; beetroot mousse, tempura prawns, seaweed and others all with very intense flavours and different texture, as a start to the dinner they were of a very high standard. The bread was accompanied by a little plate with salted butter and salt crystals with a quenelle of beef dripping butter, and let me tell you, I have never tasted something so good in my life, my partner and I were fighting over it lol. The breads also all homemade was spectacular.  From our amuse bouche to the coffee those were some of the dishes we had:  -Cannelloni of Pig`s Ear and Chorizo   root vegetables, Cornish scallop and tomato fondue -Loin of Fallow Deer   artichoke barigoule, butternut squash, braised red cabbage,   juniper and bitter chocolate sauce -Selection of European cheese,   wafers, digestives, white truffle honey  -Spiced Plum Souffl\u00e9   Tahitian vanilla ice cream and Plum sauce  -Asian Forest. All the dishes were executed to perfection and not only the presentation was perfect but the flavours, texture and combination were amazing.  The cheese selection had 12 different kind of cheese going from the mildest to the strongest served with the most beautiful/tasty/light digestive biscuits. And a little pot with honey and truffle just made the all dish unforgettable.  The service was also excellent everyone had a perfect knowledge of the products and always had time to have a little chat/feedback after each course, that made us fell vary cared.

The first problem is that I can only score up to five on the review. If I could give it six (Sublime), I would. The food, the service and the surroundings were simply wonderful. Great Fosters itself, is a beautiful tudor country house. It looked incredibly atmospheric on a foggy, freezing December day. The Tudor Room restaurant is a small restaurant, very much in keeping with the historic setting. The room is dominated by a wonderful stone fireplace. The service from Alper, the restaurant manager, and his staff was excellent. Discreet, but always around when needed. We had the six course tasting menu and, after dithering over the wine, chose to have the wine flight, with Alper choosing the wines for each course. Alper made a point of describing each wine and the reason for the pairing. Each of the wines was perfectly judged. A couple (a gewurtzraminer with the wood pigeon and the Maury vin doux with the cheese course) weren't wines that I would even have considered and both were delicious and complemented the food beautifully. All of the food courses were outstanding, from the amuse bouche of tiny croquettes (one each of salmon, fois gras and cheese) to the treacle tart and creme brulee ice cream (saved from being overly sweet by the sprinkling of pickled raisins and raised to a peak of wonderfulness with the glass of Tokaji that accompanied it).  Two of the dishes, though, were some of the best things that I've ever tasted. The seared and smoked wood pigeon, fois gras and duck confit medallions with a quince comsomme left me pretty much speechless. It looked like a little piece of perfection on the plate and tasted better. This was followed by seared scallop with a thai theme. It took a few moments for my taste buds to adjust from the sweetness of the quince comsomme to the spice of the scallops and noodles, but once they had, it was delicious. Somehow, Shane Hughes managed to turn the bok choi from the limp green thing that it is when I try and cook with it into a beautifully crisp counterpart to the softness of the noodles and scallops. Then came the next course that had me lost for words - a Jacob's ladder short rib of beef, somehow extracted from the bone in an intricate piece of butchery, with sweetbread, a watercress puree, mushrooms and purple sprouting broccoli. It was so very rich and, well, beefy. It was at this point that the fresh baked bread came into its own as we tried so very hard to scrape every last mouthful of flavour from the plate. Not very elegant, but hey ho. The cheeses were beautiful, arranged from mild to strong (the last two being roquefort and stinking bishop) and accompanied by thin, crisp wafers and small balls of digestive biscuit, plus a gorgeous truffle honey. The vin doux was a wonderful alternative to port with the cheese. Oh, and then there were espressos and petits fours to finish. A nice touch was that the petits fours came on a slate board with \"Happy Birthday\" for my wife piped onto it. All in all I can't speak highly enough of the restaurant, I can only recommend that you go soon before it gets its Michelin star and becomes much more difficult to book.", "date_of_review": "12 December 2013"}

Following a less than exceptional experience in the former Oak Room, we suspended the tradition for a couple of years, but decided to push the boat out this year and booked into the hotel for a night and into the Tudor Room for dinner. This was one of life's better decisions. The hotel had already brought two complimentary glasses of champagne to our room on our arrival, and after dressing for dinner we carried them with us to the foyer where we were met by Alper, the restaurant manager. A more affable and courteous ma\u00eetre d' would be difficult to find. He was a model of discretion and sincerity - a man who clearly took his work very seriously, and his responsibilities to his guests even more so. Throughout the evening he appeared at just the right moments, with the right advice and genuine interest in ensuring that we had the most perfect evening. We decided to go with the a la carte menu, and Alper again gently guided our wine choice, elegantly nudging us away from a Chateau Cantemerle (too young) to an excellent Chateau La Tour de By. He was keen that we should also taste an Argentinian Malbec, which was very smooth and full-flavoured, but we stuck with the Bordeaux which was much dryer by comparison, but well-suited to the mix of hare, beef and duck which comprised my starter and main-course and my wife's main. On his recommendation she took an excellent Riesling to accompany her mackerel starter. The three other waiting staff were equally discreet, but clearly equally intent on ensuring our enjoyment of a very beautifully crafted dining experience. They served three types of wonderful, freshly-baked bread which was more than adequate to see us through the meal - no skimping here, either on quality or quantity. I cannot remember tasting hare before, and was blown over by the meat, being both superbly tender, delicately structured but robust in flavour. It was accompanied by just the right quantity and intensity of sauce. The beef and my wife's pot roasted duck were equally memorable - she described hers as 'perfect'.  Dessert was a tale of two cities: my wife took the green forest dessert, which was a magnificent, eclectic but delicately balanced collection of different flavours and consistencies. I, however, plumped for the much heartier and intense pineapple and star anise tarte tatin, with bayleaf ice-cream and piquant toffee sauce. The combination rendered the whole wonderfully, but not overly sweet. We ventured into unknown territory with Alper's choice of dessert wine - very tough to find a single wine to complement such wildly different dishes - but he chose for us a lighter, cleaner, less overly syrupy wine which was more refreshing than a typical example.  The meal sadly had to end, but was concluded with coffee and petit-fours which at this stage proved close to sinking us; our man again came to the rescue, discreetly packing the beautiful little creations into a box for us to take away. I am frankly baffled by the confused and confusing description that the previous reviewer has left. It bears such a stark contrast to our experience (and that of all other reviewers), both in terms of culinary as well as service standards, that it begs a number of questions. I hope she is prepared to give the restaurant another chance - perhaps for dinner, where the ambience really comes into its own. With 33 excellent reviews and 3 very good, her poor review is a rather sad outlier.", "date_of_review": "21 December 2013"}

Set in this unique and beautiful Tudor building near Virginia Water in Surrey this new addition to the Hotel is well worth the highest praise. The food was really delicious and the service very attentive. We were a party of four and we were all full of admiration for the creation of this new fine dining venue: I would think about 24 covers at the maximum. Good wine list available.

The venue (Great Fosters Hotel) was lovely. A grand building with an authentic, traditional feel to it as you walk though the small doorway into the grand reception room. From here we were taken to our seats. A small, cozy room with only 6 or so tables of varying sizes, but, importantly, we didn't feel like everyone was listening to our conversation! We had the 4 course set menu (\u00a365pp) which had a good selection of options, although we ended up having nearer 8 courses due to the extra chef treats. All of them were delicious and you could really see the effort the chef and team put into them. There was only one sitting so we were not rushed and ate in our own time. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly. Halfway through I saw the chef poke his head out to see if everything was ok and, I assume, his customers were enjoying themselves and the food (which they were!) It's always nice to know the chef cares! Sure, the meal is comparatively expensive to your posh restaurant in town, but for what you get, it is certainly value for money! I plan to go back for sure - best restaurant I have been to! At the end of the meal ask for a coffee. They used what looked like a chemistry set to brew the coffee on your table and it is quite a spectacle. The taste certainly lived up to the build up too! Whilst having my coffee, towards the end of the night, the chef came out to chat and get feedback on the meal which was a really nice touch. Considering they only opened up this year they have really hit the ground running!", "date_of_review": "7 October 2013"}

A small plate of crispy belly pork with smooth mash was also on point and was some bavette served on kebab sticks. they were all nicely garnished with various mini veggies. i think their secret is a relatively small menu that can be handled in the small, open kitchen. the wine list is also small and fun.

Just go both for exceptional Breakfasts and selected evenings Fusion Tapas.", "comment": "A Breakfast venue until recently they have now started opening in the evenings from Tuesday to Saturday when they offer a Fusion Tapas Menu. The result is food of the highest quality. Special Prawns Tempura is as good as any anywhere including Michelin starred venues (\u00a39.50) which we started with. Fresh king Prawns done in light sage batter that came with a dip of Mirin, Ginger, Soya and Yuzu lime dip. Stunning. Followed by Sea Bream Ceviche (\u00a310.00) which was the only slightly discordant note (and it was slight) as the lime marinated fish came with a passion fruit glaze that dominated the subtle taste of the bream. The Beef Bavette (\u00a37.50) was again outstanding served as it was on generous skewers of tender beef Bavette on a bed of grilled Turkish chilli and spring onion, smoked cherry tomatoes and roasted garlic (barely noticed) scattered with a lemon flavoured sprinkling of sumac. Delightful.  The Crispy Pork Belly and creamy mash dish (\u00a38.00) again hit all the foodie right notes. Suckling pork belly yes i repeat Suckling , served with creamy mash potato with cider braised red cabbage and cranberries and pecan nuts toasted in maple syrup and balsamic vinegar.Again worth the trip on its own. Very generous portions.  Chef Roberto Albanese is a discovery so go and experience his work. Great service, Family run. accompanied by a Romanian pinot noir form Transylvania which was simple and refined (\u00a320.90).", "date_of_review": "20 April 2019"}

Opened back in 2017, the lovely Lucia and Alex run this beautiful, colourful, romantic and atmospheric restaurant just off the main road. You get a real and genuine welcome and feel thoroughly looked after during your visit. Attention to detail is everywhere, from the quality of their service right down to the little features throughout the restaurant, and of course in their incredible food. Recently Lucia and Alex opened the restaurant for dinner in addition to the much sought after breakfast and brunch that they already offer. This was a perfect opportunity for us to come down and see what all the fuss was about! The beautiful menu is sleek, sophisticated and creative. With 15 small plates to choose from, you know this place is all about quality over quantity. The suggested number of plates for one person is three so we chose the following six dishes: Baby Squid Salad (Pan fried baby squid and edamame beans, tossed with lemon gel, chili and parsley and topped with grated pecorino cheese and cress \u00a39.00) Polenta Buttons (Button shaped bites of Polenta, widely flooded with creamy Blue Cheese sauce. Crunchy roasted hazelnuts and chives \u00a36.50) Grilled Beef Bavette (Skewers of ever tender beef Bavette on a bed of grilled Turkish chilli and spring onion. Smoked cherry tomatoes and roasted garlic scattered with lemony sprinkles or sumac \u00a37.50) Special Prawns Tempura (King prawns in a special sage tempura. Mirin, ginger soya and Yuzu lime dip. Chilli, spring onion and coriander top \u00a39.50) Cured Beef Fillet (Thinly sliced cured beef with nutty crumbs of Amaretti Biscuit. An array of home-pickled mushroom with truffle oil as a finish touch \u00a39.00) Poor Dressed Like Rich \u2013 Story of An Egg (Soft poached egg in a cloud of rich potato b\u00e9chamel. Saut\u00e9ed wild mushroom and bacon with truffle oil \u00a36.50) Wild Thyme Restaurant in Shepherd's Bush Wild Thyme Restaurant in Shepherd's Bush Every single dish was incredibly presented with the most intricate of detail.The Polenta buttons were bsolutely beautiful to look at and tasted just as good too. The creamy blue cheese that oozed out of this little golden buttons was a dream! The baby squid was fantastic and the dip so thick which made it a perfect combination. The cured beef was outstanding and was so deliciously creamy. We loved the nutty addition of the Amaretti biscuits and mushroom and the truffle oil topped it off perfectly \u2013 it was absolutely divine! Poor Dressed Like Rich was also one of my all-time favourites. It was a real hearty dish and the creaminess of the truffle oil with the potato and egg was an absolute treat. We chose two out of the three desserts to try and they were absolute heaven! The Chocolate Fondant (a volcanic chocolate and raspberry fusion with vanilla ice cream \u00a35.50) was complete perfection and beautifully presented with slightly crispy chocolate on the outside and heaven on the inside. The subtle raspberry flavours enabled this dish to not be too rich and the ice cream was a great addition. The Poached Pear (Spiced poached pear in saffron, Greek yoghurt, mixed seeds and berries \u00a35.00) was gorgeous to look at and went so well with the Greek yoghurt. It was an enjoyable and relatively healthy dessert! We were absolutely gutted that this perfect restaurant isn\u2019t closer to home! If you have tried their breakfast or brunch then dinner is not to be missed. This gem of a restaurant in Shepherd\u2019s Bush was great value for the quality of the food and the service was amazing.", "date_of_review": "12 November 2018"}

However luckily for us it\u2019s recently extended to evening meals with a completely different menu.  The cuisine style is mid size share plates, but some are so good you may have trouble sharing. I lost count but there seemed to be roughly a dozen dishes to choose from. Not sectioned into starters or mains all the same size. The options covered vegetarian, meat and fish. Octopus was memorable as was the beef carpaccio with truffle oil and tiny mushrooms. The fish was fried in a light batter and served in a mini deep fry pan. Other highlights were a superbly seasoned Aubergine dish and a variation on a Greek salad. It\u2019s a good place to go with a few friends so it\u2019s easy to order everything and double up on something that\u2019s too popular. Think up market Mezze with a twist.  We ate on a mid-week night shortly after opening, so not so busy. Fortunately this gave us time to chat to the couple running the business. She is front of house and he is the chief, both Romanian which accounted for the some of the wines on the list hailing from there.

We chose the lamb and hummus which was so delicious we immediately ordered a second portion. I am Lebanese so don't do well with mock-Middle Eastern food, however, this did not disappoint and was 5-star quality and very authentic. The octopus and the calamari were similarly yummy and had beautiful smoky flavours. The aubergine salad with croutons and pomegranate was beautifully fresh as was the salmon. The wine list although small is good and we opted for the Pinot Grigio rose, which was so tasty we quickly ordered a second!

Surbiton is lucky to have this house of culinary excellence, and the quality shines out. The Christmas menu (\u00a338, three courses) included a gem of a starter; the 'marmite' of smoked haddock and Cornish mussels in a creamy saffron sauce, topped with a pastry dome. The flavours, the combination... a sumptuous dish. My companion went for the terrine of duck, ham hock, foie gras and 101 other things. Also excellent (although I was definitely the winner with the haddock). Remarkably, a woman at the table next to us called the waiter over and said she didn't like the taste of her marmite. But when the waiter apologised and reached forward to take it away, she told him to leave it, as her husband would eat it. So she got a replacement starter, while hubby had two. The word 'cheek' sprung to mind. The terrine came with its own toast, and with the French Table noted for its artisan, home-baked bread selection, there was choice in that department too. For mains, my bride chose the lamb, while I had the guinea fowl. That was a draw; both first class arrangements of flavour, exquisitely presented. The guinea fowl was positively architectural; a small housing estate of flavours on the plate, with a little lake of powerful, intense reduced gravy. We had wine by the glass, as it was lunchtime. My French red (a 14.5% oompher of a Rasteau - 2016) was very good indeed. Things were nearly spoilt when It's Looking A Lot Like Christmas suddenly came over the speakers - a brief Poundland moment in this 'Harrods' food hall. But the Kings College choir then came to the rescue. The cheese selection is wonderful, and accompanied by advice to go clockwise round the plate from an agreed starting point, so the power builds. The Aussie tawny port worked well to disentangle the flavours.  Is it really worth an \u00a38 supplement? Well, if you're already paying \u00a338, I suppose it doesn't make too much difference, but it still seems a curious addition. That said, the Camembert was rich, the Beaufort from near Areches in the mountains a lovely even, smooth cheese, and the Epoisses orange-tinged creaminess spot-on. With service and coffees, you're hard-pressed to keep lunch below 100 a head, but this was worth saving up for; an antidote to, and reward for, lockdown strictures. The odd mystery remains. Why serve sugar for the coffee in the kind of sachets you get in motorway service stations, when you could serve arty lumps in a bowl? But I've no hesitation in giving The French Table five full stars. This is cooking at, or close to, the finest it gets. A glorious lunch.", "date_of_review": "11 December 2020"}

Forget those uber eats and deliveroos the French Table's offering is in another galaxy. The food tasted devine, the attention to detail with the menu and the presentation was excellent. It is a Michelin star restaurant afterall! What's more, the preperation at home was next to nothing!

Donata greeted us at the door and took our temperatures (reassuring in these strange times!). She\u2019s expecting a baby boy in November so good luck for that - I told her boys were exhausting but very worth it! A lovely round table sparkling with cutlery and glasses - very pretty. We were served a little ravioli as an amuse-bouche, in addition to the five-course tasting menu, which was very tasty. We stuck with red wine throughout the meal - a very drinkable Mas de Vigneron. Bread was absolutely delicious and we asked for more, mainly the chorizo one. Next course was tuna - I\u2019ve never eaten it so rare but it was absolutely delicious, melt-in-the-mouth, and the avocado/watermelon salsa was a tasty surprise. Then the most beautiful work of art - a terrine of rabbit and ham hock with the most delicious tarragon jelly and plum chutney and the pistachios in the terrine were a fantastic nutty surprise along with the delicious walnut toast. Absolutely delicious. Cod to follow with a gorgeous chorizo crust, cooked to perfection with a smooth cauliflower pur\u00e9e and lovely rainbow chard - couldn\u2019t fault it. Venison was next with a lovely granola of cranberry and nuts, beautiful pommes Anna and a yum celeriac pur\u00e9e - the juniper berry jus brought it all together so wonderfully. Not sure where the blueberry sorbet came, with a light crumble, could\u2019ve been before the venison - delicious and extra again to the five courses (made seven courses in all!) The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was a triumph with a beautiful little ball of vanilla parfait within a chocolate shell. This was just so very good - superb quality ingredients, cooked to absolute perfection and some quite different combinations which were both surprising and delicious!!!! Combined with my lovely family, I was just in heaven - the perfect meal. Estelle our waitress, and Donata also, looked after us so attentively but unobtrusively. This place is fantastic!! Can\u2019t praise it highly enough - thank you chefs, just superb and just can\u2019t wait to come back for another tasting menu!!!

Our first time here but heard a lot of good things about the restaurant. All in all, a very pleasant experience, with charming staff and lovely food. The prices are not too expensive for the quality of food that they serve. I suppose one could say that portions are a little on the small side, but they were perfect for us, especially at lunch time. One small minus point was that the table next to us was especially noisy, this meant that at times it was difficult for us to hear each other.

However today the experience was somewhat spoiled for my guest by a rather indifferent service. The young lady was superb but the two guys were just unaware. It was impossible to attract their attention as they were either looking out the window or at notes or something. The normal experience of reading the room was only carried out by the lady. Oddly we had just sat down and a chef placed food in front of us. We had not been offered an aperitif or asked if we wanted a drink. We actually wondered if they had delivered someone else\u2019s meal by mistake. Water was not topped up until we deliberately spoke loud enough about the lack of attention so that the lady attending to the next table took charge and organised the other two. We had to ask for the service to slow down as it was becoming difficult for my guest to enjoy it. A sad introduction to someone when it has always been superb before. Too much work covered by the lady because the other two men just weren\u2019t professional. It improved a little towards the end. If I had been asked to add a gratuity I would have refused for the first time in my life but it was already included and I didn\u2019t want an embarrassment in front of my friend.

Were our curries extra extra spicy? No, not at all. Maybe they were for the chef but my Paneer Butter Masala tasted sweet more like a Butter Chicken and my wife Paneer dish was was also very mild. Very disappointed with the food today and glad that I don't come here on a regular basis as there are far better places elsewhere.

If you want the same standard of food for much less, go for lunch! Had lunch here last week. \u00a325 for 2 courses, \u00a328 for 3. I had crispy goats cheese in a watermelon consomme which was delicious (if a little soggy by the time I'd finished it). For main there was a very generous portion of chicken in a madeira sauce with crispy skin and mash on the side. Sublime. I was so full I only had space for petit fours but the dessert menu had a couple of classics (I would have gone for the white choc mousse if I had room). Restaurant itself is very well put together. They squeeze a good few tables in but it doesn't feel too cramped. Design is simple, bright and breeze with a semi-open kitchen. Service really was excellent. Very attentive and not shy on the homemade bread which is always a bonus. We were happy to be warned that a 20 person birthday party was about to arrive and that we should hurry up and order before them. It's the kind of place you come with a partner, your parents or that aunty you haven't seen in a while. Just on the side of classy without being pretentious.", "date_of_review": "20 August 2019"}

It was as good if not better than I remember.  The set menu, \u00a345 for a 3 course dinner, had some wonderful dishes to choose from. I started with stuffed plaice which was light, delicate but full of flavour. My wife\u2019s quail was usually good.  For the mains I had a trio of pork which again was cooked to perfection. My wife had the stone bass with lentils which I have to say was even better than mine! Our friend had the lamb. Again just perfect.  We finished with a chocolate souffl\u00e9. Wow. I\u2019m not into desserts but this was amazing.  One of our party is a vegetarian by religion, and also has a dairy intolerance. All her food was very well handled and was extremely tasty. It was all accompanied by a lovely selection of breads.   The wine we had was by the carafe, but was excellent. Well priced and superbly presented.   The service at TFT is second to none. Just perfect.   I thought for what we had that it was good value especially for dinner. It was packed all evening. I\u2019ve been to many 1* Michelin restaurants which aren\u2019t a patch on this place. Well done. ", "date_of_review": "17 April 2019"}

The food was excellent as was the variety on the menu and the management tried very hard to cater to my dietary needs.

The football was kicking off at 8pm so we were sat down around 6:30 at a decent sized table for 5 in full view of a large TV lol. The food was decent, we ordered some veggie starters and some veggie chow mein noodles which were actually quite tasty, the portions sizes could\u2019ve been slightly larger though. The service was decent and friendly so couldn\u2019t complain. We then finished our food and moved towards the DJ booth to meet other friends and watch the game, midway we ordered some deserts and got drinks, the waiter who brought the deserts didn\u2019t know which cake was what so that confused everyone and we had to swap our plates around which was not ideal! Above all the evening was pleasant and enjoyable the food was decent and tasted nice and was enjoyable, could\u2019ve been slightly spicier for our liking! The football was amazing as Liverpool won and I would return, the prices are slightly dear as you can get similar food for a better price but the interior decoration was enjoyable.", "date_of_review": "4 June 2019"}

Waiter served soup but no spoon, called waiter req spoon he sends another waiter who came with Tea spoon. Told him need soup spoon came back with long ice cream spoon for falooda. Thus 10-12 minutes gone. Not proper cutlery and crockery for starters. They were not bothered , at one stage decided to leave but had children with us so had to stay for food. In between requester Water 10 minutes no one came. had to walk to Bar counter to request water , again no one came , called Manager he was not interested.

We we were welcomed with a forceful manner to show ID and then told to follow. Little did we know we ended up at a table crammed next to other people, when it was clear to see many other spaces were available. It was a Monday night, not exactly the busiest night.  Soon as we sat down we were asked to order without even looking at the menu, it was all just very strange and aggressive.  We ordered our Shisha which arrived in good time, but we also asked for drinks that we had asked for 3 times, it took 20 minutes after the shisha arrived to receive our drinks which in the end we discovered was added to our bill 4 times! We had that sorted fortunately and taken off the bill, but it showed their lack of interest.  Last but not least, they have these heaters above all seating areas. If you have never been in a sauna, Tamara Lounge will give you a great experience of how a sauna feels. It as if I was directly under the sun during a cold -1 winter night (now you understand why I\u2019m complaining about the delayed drinks) - in the end we left because it was just too hot, and we didn\u2019t bother asking them to fix the heating, they were just ignorant and unapproachable.

Food was cold and orders were wrong. Informed the staff of our problems early in in the evening but they didn\u2019t care. Asked to see the manager about the disgusting service who didn\u2019t apologise once! RUDE INDIVIDUALS and I would never return. Over priced and up to 30 mins wait if you want a drink. They had the the nerve to add service charge on! Which obviously wasn\u2019t paid and we only paid what we thought we should for such a disgraceful meal. Toilets were so dirty.", "date_of_review": "4 January 2019"}

We ordered our starters, mains and drinks as usual. However they brought all the food all at once. We asked why the mains came at the same time as the starters and they said your table is booked for a 2 hour slot and it's new years. (The restaurant was more than half empty bear in mind) By the time we ate the starters, mains went cold, naan breads were frozen cold and gone hard and crispy. We requested a new batch of 3 naans but they charged us twice for the naans 6 in total which was ridiculous and cheeky.  We requested them to re-heat our mains and however they seemed annoyed however we still had plenty of time reserved for our table to eat and we were polite and grateful they reheated it.  My partner was about to eat his biryani and he found a knot of black hair with strands hanging deep inside the dish when he put the fork in it. It was vile and disgusting. Is there no infection control or hygiene? Do your chefs not cover their heads?  There was No apologies and the waiter looked at my partners head examining if he had put it in his own food or not which was an insult. My partner decided not to order another one and just ate what we had left as he was put off completely  Food taste was super mild and mediocre. Mixed grill was cooked well just tasted bit bland.  We requested some chutney as they didn't bother to give us them initially with two sharing platters between 4 of us and they gave us tiny little chutney to share.  Overall, an underwhelming experience, but good company. ", "date_of_review": "3 January 2019"}

Our server, Antonio, never cracked a smile and failed to get us the bill despite politely asking for it several times. Keep in mind, the restaurant was empty. He looked incredibly displeased to be serving us. Just about everyone in the restaurant looked like they were going to kill you. I'm not sure if that was because they were hoping we'd finish soon as the restaurant was privately booked from 7pm onwards. But then why let us in? I can assure you were nothing but polite and respectful. Once we'd eaten we waited at the very least 20 minutes to receive the bill and it wasn't even Antonio who'd given it to us. It was Eric who was polite, sweet and apologetic about the treatment we'd received. I have only given the service and overall rating 2 stars because of Eric. Thank you Eric! :)", "date_of_review": "6 December 2018"}
